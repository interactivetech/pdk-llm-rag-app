Hewlett Packard Enterprise unveils supercomputing research that raises the bar for achieving quantum advantage,2022-01-26,"IN THIS ARTICLE

New research showcases the value of supercomputing as a key platform to test and benchmark computational advantage in the journey to developing quantum
Results demonstrate how supercomputers, combined with optimized algorithms, can accurately compare computational advantage between classical computers and quantum computers


HOUSTON, January 26, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced new research that demonstrates how supercomputers can be used to test and benchmark computational performance for the quantum computing community, redefining theoretical performance claims that future quantum computers will deliver.  The research results reveal how a problem, called Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS), which is considered to be a domain of quantum computing, was achieved using high performance computing (HPC), or supercomputing, expanding the boundary of problems that supercomputers can address.

 In the new research, team members with HPE’s HPC and AI Business Group and Hewlett Packard Labs, HPE’s R&D arm, collaborated with the University of Bristol and Imperial College London to improve a previous prediction that it would take 600 million years to simulate a Gaussian Boson Sampling problem of the same size as an experimental quantum computer, on the world’s largest supercomputer. After developing an algorithm and applying it to a simulation of the GBS problem that ran on smaller, older generations of HPE-built supercomputers, the teams used the simulation results to predict it would take just 73 days on an even faster supercomputer1. The novel algorithm represents a billion-fold speed-up compared to previous approaches for classical computers.

 “Today’s research, a result of a strong collaboration between teams at HPE, University of Bristol and Imperial College London, was inspired by the leading edge of quantum computing development to extend the value that supercomputing delivers, when combined with optimized algorithms, to accurately compare computational advantage between classical computers and quantum computers, and set new standards of performance,” said Justin Hotard, senior vice president and general manager, HPC and AI at HPE. “We look forward to furthering this effort by partnering with the quantum computing community and integrating the HPE Cray supercomputer product line with other enabling technologies to advance the journey to developing future quantum computers.”

New research reveals the expanded boundary of computational advantage with supercomputing

The latest experiment showcases the increasing value of supercomputing and how it can be used to test and support current or near-term quantum experiments that help to accelerate the commercial relevance of quantum computers.2 The research also predicts that as supercomputing continues to advance, such as with upcoming exascale supercomputers that are up to 10 times faster than some of today’s most powerful supercomputers, quantum computing results can be verified in even shorter windows of time, from months to weeks on faster systems.

 HPE’s latest research outcome is a powerful example of the sustained value of HPC and the potential for novel algorithms in classical and quantum computing. HPE and teams were inspired by claims made in a previous paper, the Quantum Computational Advantage Using Photons, from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). In the paper, USTC’s researchers share findings from an experiment involving a large, complex quantum state of light that was measured using single photon detectors in a protocol called ""Gaussian Boson Sampling"" (GBS). USTC predicted that their simulation of GBS, which they performed on a single-purpose photonic quantum computer, in 200 seconds, would take 600 million years to simulate on the world's largest supercomputer.

 Researchers with HPE, the University of Bristol and Imperial College London, applied an algorithm that calculated exact, correlated photon detection probabilities for GBS simulations. The researchers first ran the simulations on GW4’s Isambard supercomputer and an HPE supercomputer that HPE internally uses as a test system. The simulations on these systems were then used to predict that it would take an estimated 73 days to run on today’s fastest supercomputer, and an estimated three weeks on an exascale supercomputer. The experiment and results were published in today’s paper, The Boundary of Quantum Advantage in Gaussian Boson Sampling.

HPE contributes to the quantum computing community with HPC benchmarks and milestones

To help benchmark computational advantage and identify when and where future quantum computers will unlock value, HPE is continuously exploring ways to optimize high performance computing systems, or supercomputers to validate increasingly demanding experiments and speed time-to-insight. By using heterogeneous architectures across CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and other types of accelerators, in addition to integrating purpose-built software and networking capabilities, HPE is continuing to advance HPC that is the most powerful solution today to solve the world’s most challenging problems such as in cancer diagnostics and treatment, drug design, renewable energy, sustainability, and harnessing the power of quantum mechanics for computation.

1 Prediction of 73 hours to solve a Gaussian Boson Sampling simulation was estimated for the Fugaku supercomputer
2 Near-term quantum experiments are based on today’s available quantum computers which use noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. NISQ devices are the leading quantum processors that contain or will contain nearly 50 to a few hundred qubits, but it is an open research question whether they will be advanced enough to outperform today’s most powerful supercomputers on enterprise-relevant workloads.”

Hewlett Packard Enterprise extends leadership in enterprise connectivity with private 5G offering,2022-02-23,"IN THIS ARTICLE

HPE GreenLake enables communications service providers and systems integrators to offer private networks as a service
A range of private 5G deployment scenarios are supported, including fully autonomous deployment with HPE Edgeline Converged Edge systems
The private 5G solution is pre-integrated with radio access capabilities from leading vendors


HOUSTON – Feb. 23, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that it is extending its leadership in enterprise connectivity with unique capabilities for private networking across both 5G and Wi-Fi enabling new enterprise and industrial applications from edge to cloud. Pre-integrated with radio access capabilities from leading vendors, the private 5G solution can be deployed quickly, flexibly and as a service with HPE GreenLake.

 Enterprises are increasingly looking at the promise of a customized 5G experience for low-latency, dedicated capacity, extended range and security across campus and industrial environments, whilst complementing existing Wi-Fi networks. Although 5G far surpasses Wi-Fi in terms of wide area coverage, Wi-Fi has the edge when it comes to cost-effective, indoor connectivity. With private 5G technology from HPE, customers can uniquely enjoy the best of both worlds with seamless interworking across both private 5G and Wi-Fi.

  “Data growth is creating countless new opportunities across many industries, but superfast, stable and secure connectivity is essential to enable these digital experiences,” said Tom Craig, VP and General Manager, HPE Communications Technology Group. “With our leadership in both enterprise and cellular connectivity, HPE is the perfect partner to help customers deploy private networks that are future proofed for today’s data-first reality. Together, HPE’s private 5G solution and Aruba Wi-Fi technology promises a complete private networking solution that helps to optimize the working environment, as well as giving telcos new opportunities to grow their enterprise business.” 

The private 5G solution from HPE is based on HPE 5G Core Stack, an open, cloud-native, container-based 5G core network solution. It has been enriched with new capabilities for private networking including modular operation and automation, an enterprise self-service portal, agile configuration and change management. Automated operations are managed by HPE Service Director which offers a self-service portal for enterprise users, as well as an advanced portal for service provider administrators, making life easy for customers and telcos.

 The solution supports a range of deployment types based on customer need. For sensitive or remote operations, such as military, shipping or oil and gas, HPE’s private 5G software provides a fully autonomous deployment with the HPE Edgeline EL8000 Converged Edge system, powered by 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors. Where low latency is key to supporting critical applications, such as in a hospital, the solution can be distributed in a hybrid cloud with user plane functions hosted at the edge and control plane functions hosted in the cloud.

 The combination of HPE’s private 5G solution together with Aruba wireless technologies enables telcos and enterprises to extend Wi-Fi with private cellular networking. HPE is pushing the envelope in developing synergies between Wi-Fi and 5G in order to lead the industry with seamless, secure mobility between cellular and enterprise networks with carrier-grade Quality of Service. HPE’s private 5G solutions have been designed to operate in tandem with Aruba Wi-Fi networks using technologies such as Aruba Air Pass, which automates 5G and Wi-Fi roaming. 

The private 5G solution has been pre-integrated with 5G radio access network (RAN) solutions from leading vendors for providing customers with end-to-end 5G network deployments. Technologies from Airspan Networks and other partners have been tested with HPE 5G Core Stack at the HPE 5G Lab in Fort Collins, Colorado. More radio partnerships will be added in the coming months.

 The private 5G market is developing quickly including new market entrants, such as hyperscale cloud providers. Telecoms operators are looking for simple ways to deploy private 5G networks in order to meet growing customer expectations for the connected edge. HPE recently announced that OPTAGE, a Japanese service provider, is leveraging HPE’s private 5G solution for its Local 5G testbed implementations.

 The HPE 5G Core Stack for private 5G solution and Aruba’s Wi-Fi solutions are available with HPE GreenLake. By deploying private 5G and Wi-Fi on a pay-as-you-use basis with HPE GreenLake, networks can be deployed with reduced risk, little upfront investment and scaled according to demand.

“We are seeing an explosion of enterprise interest in private networks, providing tremendous opportunity for innovation,” said Henrik Smith-Petersen, Airspan Networks Inc. Chief Sales and Marketing Officer. “Airspan is a leader in private network deployments, and working closely with HPE, offers customers a tremendous set of end-to-end 5G and Open RAN solutions, including critical 5G enterprise use cases.” 

 Last year, HPE and Airspan Networks Inc., a subsidiary of Airspan Networks Holdings Inc. (NYSE American: MIMO), validated successful interoperability for a full 5G end-to-end cloud native ecosystem through HPE’s 5G Core Stack and Airspan’s full Open RAN solution including software (CU and DU) and a sub-6GHz indoor radio (RU).

Auckland Transport adopts HPE GreenLake for advanced analytics to promote public safety  ,2022-04-06,"IN THIS ARTICLE

HPE GreenLake provides a cost-effective solution that enhances productivity and automation which encourages more people to use public transport
Auckland Transport will use AI-enhanced video feed to optimize transport routes, promote public transportation, and support decision-making for law enforcement
The new solution allows Auckland Transport to increase its camera usage, making parking officers’ jobs more effective and efficient


AUCKLAND, New Zealand – April 6, 2022– Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that Auckland Transport has selected HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform to deliver an AI-enhanced video feed to optimize transport routes, promote public transportation, and support decision-making for law enforcement.

Auckland Transport is responsible for the region’s transport services including roads, footpaths, public transport, and parking. Its day-to-day activities keep Auckland’s transport systems moving and works to address traffic congestion, encourage more people to use public transportation, and keep citizens safe on roads and in public spaces.

Previously, Auckland Transport used 2500 cameras to monitor the city for safety issues creating an ever-increasing amount of data. Auckland Transport was using aging technology, and the ongoing costs of maintenance and outsourced management of the platform were significant. The expansive system was complex, difficult to upgrade, and nearing its end of life.

Auckland Transport needed a cost-effective solution that would enhance productivity and automation as well as encourage more people to use public transport which had been significantly disrupted with the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We use the data to convert people to public transport. We know how long it takes to get from point A to point B by car and we let people know that they can get there twice as fast on the bus,” said Roger Jones, Executive General Manager, Business Technology for Auckland Transport.

Auckland Transport transitioned its video management system (VMS) to the Qumulo File Data Platform on a HPE Apollo 4200 Gen10 server running on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, resulting in a 41% rack space reduction – from 68 rack units spread across three racks, to 40 rack units in two racks, HPE GreenLake Management Services monitor and operate its VMS.

With a VMS two-thirds of the size of the original footprint, Auckland Transport has achieved a 37% decrease in energy consumption and reduced power and cooling costs, without compromising the system’s capacity to handle unstructured data in the exabyte realm.  

The modern, unified solution allows Auckland Transport to avoid upfront IT costs and enables customers to pay only for what is used, while a single, intuitive dashboard reports in real time transport flow, consumption and congestion rate, and compute and storage trends. This data is vital for forecasting and planning to enable people to move seamlessly and safely around Auckland city.

 In addition, the new solution allows Auckland Transport to increase its camera usage, making parking officers’ jobs more effective and efficient.

 “We’re excited to work with Auckland Transport and deliver a unified, cost-effective solution that uses AI to keep people safe and support their mobility,” said Colin Henderson, Managing Director, Hewlett Packard Enterprise NZ.

 “This is a perfect example of the combined power of HPE Solutions with Qumulo. Our carefully selected configurations are optimized for price, performance, and capacity requirements to deliver unstructured file data at massive scale and unmatched performance,” said Ben Gitenstein, Vice President of Product at Qumulo.

Cheops Technology selects HPE GreenLake to expand and enhance cloud services portfolio for its customers,2022-03-30,"IN THIS ARTICLE

Cheops Technology wanted to find a way to efficiently and quickly expand its service catalogue and onboard new customers, without delays
HPE GreenLake allows Cheops Technology to manage fluctuations from its customers while maintaining a robust, high availability solution


PUTEAUX, France – March 30, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that Cheops Technology, one of the leading cloud computing and service providers in France, has selected the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform to introduce a new flexible, secure cloud storage service for its SMB and healthcare customers. The new offering expands Cheops Technology’s iCod® portfolio of managed cloud services to meet increased demand from end customers to scale services to support mission-critical data growth.

Cheops Technology specializes in delivering modernized infrastructure and technologies, cloud services and network security to a range of SMB and healthcare customers. Over the past 18 months, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered increased demand from its customers for new, reliable services that can scale and be flexible to support their mission-critical data growth.

To address this, Cheops Technology wanted to find a way to efficiently and quickly expand its service catalogue and onboard new customers, without delays. Additionally, Cheops Technology wanted to expand and scale its offerings while minimizing upfront capital investment.

“We needed a solution that would easily complement our existing iCod offering with built-in flexibility and additional scale-up capacity to allow us to respond immediately to new customer orders,” said Nicolas Leroy-Fleuriot, Cheops Technology. “The HPE GreenLake platform gives us the potential scope to expand future services in line with our customers’ needs, and meet our customer demands for exceptionally high levels of availability and security.”

Building on the existing iCod offering, HPE created a HPE GreenLake cloud service to deliver intelligent storage for missions-critical applications, enabled by HPE Primera, as the foundation for Cheops Technology’s new storage cloud services.  The service is also based on usage-pricing and by accessing the HPE GreenLake Central, a centralized portal for managing and monitoring services, while gaining real-time insights on usage, Cheops Technology can improve budget predictability and easily match revenues and costs. The additional buffer capacity also allows the company to reduce time-to-market for additional services and gain any new capacity without requiring over-provisioning.

For its end customers, the scalable cloud service from HPE GreenLake allows Cheops Technology to manage fluctuations from its customers while maintaining a robust, high availability solution. The cloud service will be hosted in data centers based in Bordeaux, France to ensure business continuity and data sovereignty which are important to Cheops Technology’s customers.

“The HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform enables our partners to build on to their existing resources to meet new demands for flexible and advanced technologies, while allowing them to scale as their business, and their customers’ businesses, grow,” said Paul d’Alena, Channel Director, HPE. “We look forward to continuing our partnership with Cheops Technology to expand and bolster its offerings using HPE GreenLake and deliver new experiences to its customers.”

Previously, HPE also worked closely with Cheops Technology to design and implement a modernized technology platform for Salomon, a leading outdoor sports equipment manufacturer, also using the HPE GreenLake platform to meet Salomon’s increased demands for flexibility.

Fiscal 2022 second quarter non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude after-tax adjustments of approximately $0.23 per diluted share, primarily related to transformation costs, stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of intangible assets.

Fiscal 2022 outlook:

Hewlett Packard Enterprise raises GAAP diluted net EPS outlook of $1.36 to $1.50 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS outlook of $2.03 to $2.17. Fiscal 2022 non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude after-tax adjustments of approximately $0.67 per diluted share, primarily related to transformation costs, stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of intangible assets.

1 As-a-Service (“AAS”) orders are an overlay across all business segments contributing to HPE’s consumption-based services (both recurring and non-recurring), and includes hardware, as well as GreenLake as-a-Service, Aruba SaaS, CMS SaaS, and other Software assets.

2 Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides certain guidance on a non-GAAP basis, as the Company cannot predict some elements that are included in reported GAAP results. Refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures below for more information.

3 Annualized Revenue Run-Rate (“ARR”) is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services (“CS”) offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income for capital leases), and software-as-a-Service, software consumption revenue, and other as-a-Service offerings recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it.

Use of non-GAAP financial information and key performance metrics

To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on a generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides financial measures, including revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, cash flow from operations, and free cash flow, each excluding litigation judgment, net of taxes paid. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. A reconciliation of adjustments to GAAP financial measures for this quarter and prior periods is included in the tables below or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release. In addition, an explanation of the ways in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its business, the substance behind Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s decision to use these non-GAAP measures, the material limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures, the manner in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management compensates for those limitations, and the substantive reasons why Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors is included under “Use of non-GAAP financial measures” further below. This additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, gross profit, gross profit margin, operating profit (earnings from operations), operating profit margin, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, cash flow from operations, or investments in property, plant and equipment prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 In addition to the supplemental non-GAAP financial information, Hewlett Packard Enterprise also presents annualized revenue run-rate (""ARR"") and as-a-Service (""AAS"") orders as performance metrics. ARR is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services (""CS"") offerings. ARR represents the annualized value of all recurring net HPE GreenLake services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income for operating leases and interest income for capital leases), and Software-as-a-Service (""SaaS""), software consumption revenue, and other as-a-Service offerings recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. AAS orders are an overlay across all business segments contributing to HPE's consumption-based services (both recurring and non-recurring revenues), and includes hardware, as well as HPE GreenLake as-a-Service, Aruba SaaS, CMS SaaS, and other Software assets. ARR & AAS orders should be viewed independently of net revenue and deferred revenue and are not intended to be combined with any of these items.

Use of non-GAAP financial measures

To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides financial measures including revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, cash flow from operations and free cash flow, each excluding litigation judgment, net of taxes paid. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow.

 These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to revenue on a constant currency basis is revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) is operating profit (earnings from operations). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin is operating profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income tax rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to cash flow from operations and free cash flow, each excluding litigation judgment, net of taxes paid, is cash flow from operations. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are included in the tables above or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release.

Use and economic substance of non-GAAP financial measures used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise

Revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges relating to the amortization of initial direct costs and stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) and non-GAAP operating profit margin are defined to exclude any charges relating to the amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets, transformation costs, disaster charges, stock-based compensation expense and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges, as well as an adjustment to tax indemnification and related adjustments, non-service net periodic benefit credit, litigation judgment, early debt redemption costs, earnings from equity interests, certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of U.S. tax reform, and excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. In addition, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item.

 Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s historical and prospective financial performance, as well as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s performance relative to its competitors. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management also uses these non-GAAP measures to further its own understanding of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segment operating performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to better understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segments, as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. More specifically, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons:
 

Amortization of initial direct costs represents the portion of lease origination costs incurred in prior fiscal years that do not qualify for capitalization under the new leasing standard. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these costs as the Company elected the practical expedient under the new leasing standard. As a result, the Company did not adjust these historical costs to accumulated deficit to align with other reasons below. The Company believes that most financing companies did not elect this practical expedient and therefore the Company excludes these costs to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparisons to its peers.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions and any related impairment charges. Consequently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Transformation costs represent net costs related to the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan and HPE Next initiative and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to transform Hewlett Packard Enterprise's IT infrastructure and gains from the sale of real-estate identified as part of the initiative as well as any impairment charges on real-estate assets identified as part of the initiative. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating such expenses and gains for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s past operating performance.


Disaster charges primarily include direct costs resulting from COVID-19 as a result of Hewlett Packard Enterprise-hosted, co-hosted, or sponsored event cancellations and shift to a virtual format. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating these amounts for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses and such an exclusion facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs costs related to its acquisition, disposition and other related charges, most of which are treated as non-cash or non-capitalized expenses. The charges are direct expenses such as professional fees and retention costs. Charges may also include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal and arbitration settlements in connection with certain dispositions. Because non-cash or non-capitalized acquisition-related expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions and divestitures, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating such expenses for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s past operating performance.


Tax indemnification and related adjustments are primarily related to changes in certain pre-separation tax liabilities for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise was indemnified under the Termination and Mutual Release Agreement. These adjustments also include changes to certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise remains liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these income or charges and the associated tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Non-service net periodic benefit credit includes certain market-related factors such as (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains or losses, (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments and (vi) impacts from other market-related factors associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise's defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans. These market-driven retirement-related adjustments are primarily due to the change in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures and considers them to be outside the operational performance of the business.


In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, Hewlett Packard Enterprise received $2.35 billion from Oracle Corporation towards satisfaction of judgment related to the Itanium litigation. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes this gain for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurred early debt redemption costs of $100 million relating to the early redemption of 4.65% Senior Notes with an original maturity date of October 1, 2024. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Adjustment to earnings from equity interests includes the amortization of the basis difference in relation to the H3C divestiture and the resulting equity method investment in H3C. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating this amount for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise utilizes a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly related to the Company’s operating structure that can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, Hewlett Packard Enterprise evaluated a three-year financial projection. The projected rate assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year projection period, and considers other factors including Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where Hewlett Packard Enterprise operates. For fiscal 2022, the Company will use a projected non-GAAP income tax rate of 14%, which reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP income tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. For fiscal 2021, the Company had a non-GAAP income tax rate of 14%. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that making these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures, facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.


Material limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are:
 

Amortization of initial direct cost is excluded from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, which can have an impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure and HPE Financial Services Segment results.


Items such as stock-based compensation expense that is excluded from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


Amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s cash position, represents the loss in value of intangible assets over time. The expense associated with this loss in value is excluded from non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


Items such as transformation costs, disaster charges and acquisition, and disposition and other related costs that are excluded from non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures and cash flow.


Items such as adjustment to non-service net periodic benefit credit, litigation judgment, early debt redemption costs, and earnings from equity interests that are excluded from non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


Items such as tax indemnification and related adjustments, certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the related tax impacts from other non-GAAP measures that are excluded from the non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can also have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures.


Free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period.


Other companies may calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share differently than Hewlett Packard Enterprise does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

 
Compensation for limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

Hewlett Packard Enterprise compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure within this news release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise encourages investors to review those reconciliations carefully.

 Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors

Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that providing financial measures including revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, cash flow from operations and free cash flow, each excluding litigation judgment, net of taxes paid, to investors in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results “through the eyes” of management. Hewlett Packard Enterprise further believes that providing this information better enables Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s investors to understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance with the performance of other companies in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.

HPE GreenLake selected by Worldline to modernize mission-critical payments,2022-03-22,"IN THIS ARTICLE

HPE GreenLake can scale up and down as business demand fluctuates and will significantly improve the performance of Wordline's payment platform

The old data center IT infrastructure will be decommissioned after a transition in a safe and sustainable manner in HPE's Technology Renewal Center to minimize electronic waste
By leveraging HPE Financial Services' asset renewal program, funding approximately 25% of the platform refresh, Worldline achieved this significant upgrade with no upfront investment


BRUSSELS, Belgium – March 22, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that Worldline, a European-based global payments provider, has selected the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform to implement a major performance upgrade to its mission-critical payments platform to meet the accelerated growth of online transactions. By leveraging HPE GreenLake's flexible as-a-service model and HPE Financial Services' asset renewal program, funding approximately 25% of the platform refresh, Worldline achieved this significant upgrade with no upfront investment.

 Worldline is the largest European and the world’s fourth largest payment provider, with operations in over 50 countries. The company provides payments and transactional services to the full supply chain – from seller to buyer -- and has been delivering on a vision of a cashless economy by developing agile, customer-centric solutions that are rooted in strong technology. The industry relies heavily on back-end infrastructure to ensure the payment value chain is resilient, highly available and always on.  Latency and downtime on card transactions have an immediate impact on the customer experience.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on the finance and banking sector with significant fluctuations in demand and revenue. Over the same period there has been a massive growth in online purchasing as more countries transform into cashless societies resulting in an even greater reliance on secure global payment transactions. Worldline, like many payment providers, needed to quickly and efficiently scale-up its offering to support its vendors and customers with the growing volume of digital payments, further improving its existing reliable estate of servers and storage that needed to meet the current and future demand and reduce ongoing operational costs.

The HPE GreenLake platform can scale up and down as business demand fluctuates so that Worldline can manage the growth in demand.  The platform delivers the cloud experience through a pay-per-use model while also meeting compliance and regulatory requirements.

“Working with HPE has enabled us to navigate the turbulent market caused by COVID-19 via a combination of legacy asset buy-back and a flexible as-a-service approach,” said Frédéric Papillon, Managing Director Production Systems at Worldline. “We feel confident that these solutions will enable us to offer our customers a highly secure and efficient platform for digital transactions that keeps the supply chain moving, and also provide a cost-competitive solution that delivers value for money.”

The HPE GreenLake platform solution leverages HPE NonStop systems, which are ideally suited to support payment transactions with trusted, reliable, 100% fault-tolerant capabilities required for mission critical environments. HPE NonStop meets the stringent demands of a secure financial transaction workload, with the always-on, resilient design ensuring operational excellence and exceptionally high levels of availability. The solution was identified as the best cloud service to support Worldline’s mission critical business with the agility and flexibility to deliver an accelerated time-to-market for new applications and services.

The old data center IT infrastructure will be decommissioned after a transition in a safe and sustainable manner in HPE's Technology Renewal Center to minimize electronic waste. The transformation to the new platform will be managed by HPE Pointnext Services in close collaboration with Worldline, without any disruption to the existing workflows.

 “Together, the HPE GreenLake platform and HPE Financial Services capabilities will allow Worldline to achieve significant cost savings, and also power a significant refresh and modernization of their mission-critical payments platform,” said Gilles Thiebaut, Managing Director, SVP Global Sales for Northern Western Europe. “This upgrade, delivering improved performance and extending the operational life, was achieved without any upfront investment and is delivered on a pay-per-use model so the solution meets both their technical and financial requirements.”

Napa Valley’s Trinchero Family Estates supports online business growth with HPE GreenLake,2022-03-22,"IN THIS ARTICLE

Trinchero Family Estates used HPE GreenLake to upgrade compute resources to support departments from labeling and bottling to packaging and distribution
HPE collaborated with PKA Technologies Inc., a HPE Platinum channel partner, on transforming TFE’s operations


HOUSTON – March 22, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that Trinchero Family Estates (TFE), a family-owned global wine and spirits producer, transformed and modernized its expanding business with the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. The initiative was completed in strong collaboration with PKA Technologies Inc., a HPE Platinum channel partner.

“Our customers turn to the HPE GreenLake platform, that is underpinned by HPE’s powerful compute technologies, for its data-first, unified experience that allows them to modernize their organization by choosing and scaling cloud services based on their business goals,” said Neil MacDonald, senior vice president and general manager, Compute, at HPE. “We are honored to have collaborated with one of our key channel partners, PKA Technologies, to accelerate Trinchero Family Estates’ digital transformation for its worldwide wine and spirits operation and unlock faster value using composable compute services in one cloud platform.”

Trinchero Family Estates embraces unprecedented online demands in the wake of COVID-19

Family-owned Trinchero Family Estates (TFE) is based in Napa Valley, California – one of the world’s premier wine regions. TFE has operated for more than 70 years, and to date, has a robust portfolio of more than 50 acclaimed brands, including Ménage à Trois, Joel Gott Wines, SEAGLASS Wine Company and Tres Agaves Organic Tequila, in addition to Sutter Home – the creator of the world’s first-ever White Zinfandel.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a majority of people sheltered-in-place and purchased more goods online, TFE experienced a significant spike in demand, resulting in dynamic shifts in overall production from bottling and labeling to packaging and distribution. The surge in orders also generated large amounts of data as consumer data analysis took top priority in targeting sales to appropriate audiences and markets.

“At Trinchero Family Estates, we are committed to continuing our legacy of delivering memorable experiences to customers worldwide with our global portfolio of brands,” said Jeremy Mostafanejad, senior director, infrastructure/operations at Trinchero Family Estates. “As our business has grown – creating new demands for technology resources – we turned to HPE and PKA Technologies to transform our IT environment and control costs by using advanced HPE Synergy solutions – delivered as a cloud service – through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. With the new cloud service, we gained a significant boost in compute capacity and support for an expanding data warehouse – both essential for the continued growth of our business.”

Modernizing all applications and data using HPE GreenLake for Composable Compute

To manage the fluctuation and data growth from increased orders, along with ageing on-premises infrastructure, TFE consulted with PKA Technologies, one of HPE’s key channel partners, on how to transform and modernize its data assets while avoiding financial risk associated with new technology investments.

 After advising on the HPE GreenLake platform, PKA implemented the solution to seamlessly transition TFE’s applications and data across multi-functions. In doing so, TFE easily upgraded its previous solutions, using HPE Synergy, a composable, software-defined infrastructure, to a newer generation with faster performance and overall advanced, flexible capabilities to support all of its business applications. TFE immediately saw results of speeding up application performance from up to 5-10 minutes, to just seconds.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise accelerates RAN deployments with automation and simplified management for both open and traditional networks,2022-04-21,"IN THIS ARTICLE

HPE RAN Automation, a service management and orchestration solution, provides multi-vendor management and automation for any Radio Access Network (RAN)
This cloud-native solution, delivered as a service, offers zero-touch management of multi-vendor RAN infrastructure
HPE RAN Automation is a key part of the HPE Open RAN Solution Stack and has been validated and optimized  the HPE ProLiant DL110 Gen10 Plus – Telco server


HOUSTON, Texas – April 21, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced HPE RAN Automation, a service management and orchestration solution that provides multi-vendor management and automation for any Radio Access Network (RAN) and helps communications service providers increase operational efficiency and accelerate deployment.

This pre-integrated cloud-native solution, delivered as a service, leverages HPE operations support systems and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies to offer zero-touch management of multi-vendor RAN infrastructure. The solution orchestrates the full life-cycle of both virtual Distributed Units (vDUs) and virtual Centralized Units (vCUs), enabling operators to dynamically configure radio frequency parameters and optimize the use of radio access resources and spectrum.

“While the direction towards the open disaggregated RAN is clear, many operators will have to manage a mixture of existing 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, virtualized RAN and Open RAN solutions over the next few years,” said Tom Craig, VP and GM, HPE Communications Technology Group. “The winners will be those who embrace automation and commit to a disaggregated, open, multi-vendor future. Building on our experience gained from one of the largest RAN disaggregation deployments in the industry, HPE RAN Automation provides a pre-integrated, truly open, fully vendor agnostic solution that addresses existing, pure Open RAN and traditional networks. With this latest innovation, we are introducing a zero-touch operational experience to manage the ever-growing complexity, accelerate roll out and optimize multi-vendor radio access networks.”

Interest in Open RAN is growing rapidly with the majority of operators either piloting or planning to make significant investments in disaggregated radio access technology over the coming years. Operators are looking to the industry to bring scale and innovation through workload-optimized x86 based hardware, specifically tuned to run virtualized radio access software. In addition, AI-driven management and automation tools will be essential to simplify RAN operations and engineering for the multi-vendor, multi-generational disaggregated RAN.

HPE RAN Automation is delivered as a service on a public or private cloud as a pre-integrated set of capabilities and operated centrally by HPE offering the following:
 
·         Fully-automated lifecycle management with AI/ML powered assurance –detects anomalies, predict failures, correlate information across the hardware and software layers, perform advanced analytics and send actionable signals to the appropriate components to take action according to the specific use cases.
·         A single secure web user interface –allows operators to interact with the different functions of the platform with single sign-on authentication.
·         A consistent set of management capabilities across heterogeneous hosting environments, compliant with ETSI specifications –supports operators by providing the ability to onboard and deploy third party RAN vDU and vCU network functions.

HPE RAN Automation follows the principles of O-RAN Alliance’s Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) architecture which provides the capability to provision, monitor and operate all layers of the disaggregated RAN from infrastructure to RAN software. Furthermore, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices ensure that HPE RAN Automation is constantly updated according to the latest O-RAN standards and integrates seamlessly with the latest software updates from RAN partners.

The first step operators usually face is the rollout of RAN optimized hardware across thousands of distributed sites. HPE RAN Automation addresses this challenge and supports operators with a step-by-step approach as they move towards Open RAN, by utilising the HPE Resource Aggregator for Open Distributed Infrastructure Management, a DMTF Redfish based open-source framework to manage diverse edge infrastructure.

Once the infrastructure and the network functions are in place, HPE RAN Automation supports further advanced AI capabilities and standardized interfaces to offer O-RAN compliant non-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) functionality and host a suite of radio network applications (rApps) from HPE and partners.  Initial deployments of HPE RAN Automation will include a radio frequency (RF) configuration and optimization module. This capability is integrated with the AI/ML assurance and orchestration modules to automate RF parameters provisioning and operations according to specific services and policies set by the operators.

“5G is expected to yield more complex network engineering and a myriad of vendor network types, driven by multi-technology and multivendor solutions,” says Ahmad Latif Ali, Associate VP at IDC. “While many operators are still refining their own network transformation and road maps, open network architectures will undeniably play a key role in driving RAN evolution. The creation and development of new RAN ecosystems will be critical for operators with management and orchestration through end-to-end automation becoming a key strategic priority for those CSPs looking to effectively operate their heterogenous environments, consisting of 5G and previous generations of mobile networks deployed across multiple clouds and on traditional physical infrastructure.”

HPE RAN Automation is a key part of the HPE Open RAN Solution Stack and has been validated and optimized for the the HPE ProLiant DL110 Gen10 Plus – Telco server, the industry’s first Open RAN workload optimized server, enabling faster deployment of Open RAN.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise drives innovation at the extreme edge on the International Space Station with 24 completed experiments,2022-04-04,"IN THIS ARTICLE

Spaceborne Computer-2 is the first edge computing and AI solution installed on the ISS to process data in-real time
The solution has already supported experiments in collaboration with Axiom Space, Cornell University, Cumucore, Microsoft, NASA and Titan Space Technologies


HOUSTON, Texas – April 4, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that the HPE Spaceborne Computer-2 (SBC-2), the first in-space commercial edge computing and AI-enabled system to run on the International Space Station (ISS), has successfully completed 24 research experiments, accelerating time-to-insight from months and days, to minutes.

The experiments involved real-time data processing and testing of new applications to prove reliability in space as part of an effort to increase autonomy for astronauts. These experiments spanned uses cases supporting healthcare, image processing, natural disaster recovery, 3D printing, 5G, and solutions enabled by artificial intelligence.

Breaking ground for edge computing and AI in space with Spaceborne Computer-2

HPE launched Spaceborne Computer-2, in collaboration with the ISS National Laboratory, to space in February 2021 and was installed on the ISS in May 2021. The solution is comprised of HPE’s edge computing solutions, the HPE Edgeline Converged EL4000 Edge system, which provides a rugged and compact system designed to perform in harsher edge environments, such as space, and the HPE ProLiant DL360 server, a trusted, industry-standard server, for additional high-performing capabilities to target a range of workloads, including edge, HPC, AI, etc.

SBC-2 is part of a greater mission to significantly advance computing and reduce dependence on communications as humans travel farther into space to the Moon, Mars and beyond. The solution also demonstrates potential ways astronauts can increase self-sufficiency when processing data directly on the space station, in real-time, bypassing longer latency and wait times that occur when relying on sending raw data to Earth to be processed, analyzed, and sent back to space.

Enabling faster computing and shorter download times to Earth with 20,000X speed-up

The edge computing capabilities delivered through SBC-2 also have the potential to enable astronauts and space explorers to send data to Earth, whether to be further analyzed or used in another way, at a radically compressed size and faster speed. Previously, 1.8 GB of raw DNA sequence data took an average time of 12.2 hours just to download to Earth for initial processing. With SBC-2, researchers onboard the space station processed that same data in just six minutes to gather meaningful insights, compressed it to 92 KB and sent it to Earth in just two seconds, representing a 20,000X speed-up.1

Spaceborne Computer-2 completes 24 experiments using in-space edge computing and AI

Since its installment on the ISS, Spaceborne Computer-2 ran dozens of experiments by processing data at the edge, in real-time, for researchers with organizations developing breakthrough capabilities for space exploration such as Axiom Space, Cornell University, Cumucore, Microsoft, NASA and Titan Space Technologies. Example xperiments include:
 

 Experiment focused on increasing human safety and self-sufficiency by using AI-enabled damage detection in astronaut gloves - Astronauts on the ISS are often on spacewalks where they repair equipment, install new instruments and upgrade features and functions on the space station. They wear essential gloves that can experience natural erosion, along with even rips and cuts, that can present potential safety concerns. In an experiment led by NASA, HPE and Microsoft, photos and recorded video taken in space of recently worn gloves by astronauts, were processed using Spaceborne Computer-2’s AI-enabled capabilities. The glove analyzer model, jointly developed by NASA and Microsoft, was then used to rapidly look for signs of damage on-orbit, in space. If damage is detected, an AI-annotated photo is generated in space and immediately sent to Earth, highlighting areas for further review by NASA engineers.

Automatic interpretation of satellite imagery after a disaster – NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) observes Earth from space to study science and climate, as well as support disaster response. Using Spaceborne Computer-2 in concert with embedded processors, NASA JPL tested several deep learning inference networks to automatically interpret remote sensed images from land and structures after a disaster. For example, two such techniques use radar data from the UAVSAR platform to: determine flood extent, such as from a hurricane, and to determine urban building damage, such as from an earthquake. These techniques could be used onboard future spacecraft to rapidly deliver actionable products to relevant authorities to assist in disaster recovery.


Enabling 3D printing in space with validated software - As humans look to future deep space travel, ordering supplies to repair or build new equipment from Earth will not be timely and practical. To increase self-sufficiency by enabling additive manufacturing for humans traveling beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), Cornell Fracture Group, part of Cornell University, a leading research university, developed a modeling software that can simulate 3D printing of metal parts and even predict any failure and deformation that may result when printing in the harsh condition of space. The software was successfully tested on Spaceborne Computer-2, validating that it can be used in space to digitally simulate a part and understand how it will perform in reality.


Expanding network capability on the ISS with a 5G core prototype – Cumucore, a private mobile network solution provider, tested its 5G core network, along with RAN emulators and other features, on Spaceborne Computer-2, to emulate current capabilities on the base station and end user devices. The validation demonstrated the potential to install state-of-the-art 5G capabilities on selected satellites and spacecraft to unlock a new level of communications in space. The validation also has the potential to support near future opportunities using 5G due to the rapid expansion of the commercialization of space.


Developing software codes to calculate fuel requirements based on space travel distance -- As part of HPE’s ongoing work with students worldwide to mentor and support efforts in STEM research, HPE opened up Spaceborne Computer-2 to students in India involved in Codewars, an educational community and competition for computer programming. The projects largely focused on developing code using C++, Python and Fortran, with one involving C++ Pythagoras theorem code to calculate how much fuel is needed for given space travel distance to directly travel to without requiring refueling.

HOUSTON, Texas – April 27, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced the launch of HPE Swarm Learning, a breakthrough AI solution to accelerate insights at the edge, from diagnosing diseases to detecting credit card fraud, by sharing and unifying AI model learnings without compromising data privacy.

 HPE Swarm Learning, which was developed by Hewlett Packard Labs, HPE’s R&D organization, is the industry’s first privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning framework for the edge or distributed sites.1 The solution provides customers with containers that are easily integrated with AI models using the HPE swarm API. Users can then immediately share AI model learnings within their organization and outside with industry peers to improve training, without sharing actual data. 

“Swarm learning is a new, powerful approach to AI that has already made progress in addressing global challenges such as advancing patient healthcare and improving anomaly detection that aid efforts in fraud detection and predictive maintenance,” said Justin Hotard, executive vice president and general manager, HPC & AI, at HPE. “HPE is contributing to the swarm learning movement in a meaningful way by delivering an enterprise-class solution that uniquely enables organizations to collaborate, innovate, and accelerate the power of AI models, while preserving each organization’s ethics, data privacy, and governance standards.”

VIDEO: The Big Shift: What is Swarm Learning?

Introducing a new AI approach to securely harness insights at the edge

Today, the majority of AI model training occurs at a central location, which relies on centralized merged datasets. However, this approach can be inefficient and costly due to having to move large volumes of data back to the same source. It can also be constrained by data privacy and data ownership rules and regulations that limit data sharing and movement, which can potentially lead to inaccurate and biased models. By training models and harnessing insights at the edge, businesses can make decisions faster, at the point of impact, leading to better experiences and outcomes. Additionally, by sharing learnings from one organization to another at the data source, various industries across the world can unite and further improve intelligence that can lead to tremendous business and societal outcomes.

 However, sharing data externally may raise a challenge for organizations that are required to meet data governance, regulatory or compliance requirements, mandating that data stay at its location. HPE Swarm Learning uniquely enables organizations to use distributed data at its source, which increases the dataset size for training, to build machine learning models to learn in an equitable way, while preserving data governance and privacy. To ensure that only learnings captured from the edge are shared, and not the data itself, HPE Swarm Learning uses blockchain technology to securely onboard members, dynamically elect a leader, and merge model parameters to provide resilience and security to the swarm network. Additionally, by only sharing the learnings, HPE Swarm Learning allows users to leverage large training datasets, without compromising privacy, and helps remove biases to increase accuracy in models.

“Swarmifying” data to empower AI for the greater good

HPE Swarm Learning can help a range of organizations to collaborate and improve insights:
 

Hospitals can derive learnings from imaging records, CT and MRI scans, and gene expression data to be shared from one hospital to another to improve diagnostics of diseases and other ailments, while protecting patient information.


Banking and financial services can fight the expected global loss of more than $400 billion in credit card fraud over the next decade2, by sharing fraud-related learnings with more than one financial institution at a time.


Manufacturing sites can benefit from predictive maintenance to gain insight into equipment repairing needs and address them before they fail and cause unwanted downtime. By leveraging swarm learning, maintenance managers can gain better insight by collecting learnings from sensor data across multiple manufacturing sites.

 
Example use cases of early HPE Swarm Learning adopters include:

University of Aachen studies histopathology to accelerate diagnosis of colon cancer

A team of cancer researchers at University Hospital of RWTH University Aachen in Germany conducted a study to advance diagnosis of colon cancer by applying AI on image processing to predict genetic alterations, which can cause cells to become cancerous.

 The researchers trained AI models using HPE Swarm Learning on three groups of patients from Ireland, Germany and the U.S. and validated the prediction performance in two independent datasets from the United Kingdom using the same, swarm learning-based AI models. The results demonstrated that the original AI models, training only on local data, were outperformed using swarm learning due to sharing learnings, but not the patient data, with other entities to improve predictions.

TigerGraph advances anomaly detection to help banks fight credit card fraud 

TigerGraph, provider of a leading graph analytics platform, combines HPE Swarm Learning with its data analytics offering running on HPE ProLiant servers using AMD EPYC™ processors to augment efforts in quickly detecting unusual activity in credit card transactions. The combined solution increases accuracy when training machine learning models from vast quantities of financial data from multiple banks and branches, across geological locations.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise opens new head office in Canada to realize a new workplace experience for team members,2022-05-03,"IN THIS ARTICLE

The new Canadian head office provides a dynamic and collaborative culture in which HPE team members can thrive, with a particular emphasis on graduates
The new space boasts a Customer Innovation Center, allowing HPE to host customers and partners for executive briefings, workshops and technology showcases


TORONTO, CA – May 3, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that it has opened a new head office in Toronto, Canada, designed to enhance team members’ onsite experiences; from facilitating collaboration, heightening culture-building, and providing amenities to let teams get the greatest benefit that coming together affords while maximizing flexibility and wellness.

In 2021, HPE created the Edge-to-Office experience, which prioritizes flexibility and choice in the balance between office and remote work while maintaining a strong culture and connectedness. Offices, such as the new campus in Toronto, are envisioned and transformed into hubs for collaboration and social interaction, rather than full time dedicated workstations.

“HPE approached the work-from-home situation from two angles – as both an employer of 60,000+ team members, and as an IT infrastructure provider that companies rely on to help unlock value from their own data and technology,” said Mike Hilton, president and managing director, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Canada. “We needed to be an example we could point to when speaking with our clients on how to adapt to hybrid or distributed environments, so Edge-to-Office is part of our DNA. And for us, when we talk about our workplace, we’re not necessarily talking about a physical location, but rather, it’s the team member experience and ways that we show up for each other and our clients every day. We continue to invest in tools and resources to keep team members connected and promote collaboration, for both in-person and virtual environments.”

The new Canadian head office provides a dynamic and collaborative culture in which HPE team members can thrive, with a particular emphasis on graduates. For those starting their careers, hands-on training and support is beneficial, and the camaraderie and social aspects of working life help shape their unique experiences.  Wellness and the environment are also a crucial part of the site’s DNA, with large amounts of bike parking, outdoor spaces with seating and tables, as a fitness center, showers, lockers, a cafe, and an eatery on site. The new space also boasts a Customer Innovation Center, allowing HPE to host customers and partners for executive briefings, workshops and technology showcases.

The workplace cultural evolution was underway at HPE well before the sudden arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even before the pandemic, HPE was leading innovation that enabled employees to work remotely or under a hybrid in-office/remote model. As much as 60 per cent of the HPE workforce routinely worked outside the office, underscoring team member preference for flexible working conditions and productivity while offsite. HPE regularly surveys team members regarding their preferences for HPE’s work environment, and the data showed that team members enjoy the flexibility to work outside the office, preferring to use the office for collaboration and social connections.

“The Edge-to-Office program has been a boon for the company and team members. With hybrid working situations the norm, we can pull talent from all over the country, no longer bound by long commutes. The flexibility allows our colleagues the opportunity to fit HPE into their lives, rather than the other way around,” added Hilton.

HPE statement on UK High Court decision in Autonomy proceedings – May 2022,2022-05-17,"On May 17, 2022 Mr. Justice Hildyard of the UK High Court released his full detailed judgment in the $5 billion civil fraud suit filed in 2015, and tried throughout the majority of 2019 into early 2020, by HPE/Autonomy against Autonomy founder and former CEO Mike Lynch and former CFO Sushovan Hussain.

 In his detailed judgment, Mr. Justice Hildyard concluded: ""In the result, I have determined that the Claimants have succeeded in substantially all their claims…. They have established…. that the Defendants dishonestly misrepresented the financial position and performance of Autonomy during the Relevant Period. I consider that HP/Bidco bought a smaller and less successful company than it was represented to be and that HP was led to and did believe that it was acquiring. One of the tragedies of the case is clear: an innovative and ground-breaking product, its architect and the company will probably always be associated with fraud.""

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Releases 2021 Living Progress Report; Accelerates Net-zero Climate Target by 10 Years,2022-06-22,"IN THIS ARTICLE

HPE has released its annual Living Progress Report for Fiscal Year 2021, demonstrating the company’s ongoing commitment to creating a more equitable, sustainable world
In the report, HPE shares it’s progress toward, and plans for, driving a low-carbon economy, investing in a diverse and inclusive workforce and operating with the highest ethical standards


HOUSTON – June 22, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today unveiled its annual Living Progress Report for fiscal year 2021, demonstrating the company’s ongoing commitment to creating a more equitable and sustainable world by accelerating targets for net-zero emissions, developing technology solutions that drive a low-carbon economy, investing in a diverse and inclusive workforce and operating its business with and insisting on the highest ethical standards.

 “We don’t just help our customers meet their ESG goals, we continue to push ourselves and our entire industry forward by improving upon our own,” said Antonio Neri, President and CEO. “At HPE, we have a significant responsibility and an intentional, focused plan to help our customers, suppliers and communities successfully transition to a zero-carbon future.”

Charting a course towards net-zero emissions

HPE’s seventh annual report reaffirms HPE’s promise to become a net-zero enterprise across its entire value chain, accelerating its target date by 10 years from 2050 to 2040. This commitment is backed by a new suite of targets that are consistent with a 1.5-degree Centigrade climate pathway and approved by the Science-based Target Initiative. By 2030, HPE pledges to reduce emissions within its own operations by 70% from 2020 levels, building on the 62% reduction already achieved over the five prior years. HPE will also reduce Scope 3 emissions by 42%, focusing on the use of sold products, upstream transportation and distribution, and direct supply chain emissions. By 2040, the company plans to reduce its entire global footprint by 90%.

 To advance accountability to reach these new goals, HPE has introduced two new initiatives that will drive ESG progress at the leadership level:
  

In 2022, all Vice President and above leaders will complete a mandatory climate training program with the aim of empowering leaders to create action plans within their organizations that mitigate climate impact.


Additionally, HPE has introduced a new compensation metric for members of its Executive Committee that ties a portion of variable pay to HPE’s management of carbon emissions across its value chain.

 
As-a-service transition empowers customers to operate sustainably and efficiently

HPE’s transition to a consumption-based, as-a-service company is driving sustainable transformation efforts for its customers. With the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, customers can flexibly scale their IT to meet their needs, thereby improving utilization levels and avoiding the waste of overprovisioning. Customers transitioning to HPE GreenLake from traditional CapEx models can achieve a greater than 30% reduction in energy costs and total cost of ownership. For example, Auckland Transport (AT), which records traffic across New Zealand, transitioned its video management system to the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. In doing so, AT was able to pay for only the cloud services they used, add 60% more cameras to their system, and reduce their energy consumption 37%.

 In addition to helping customers transition to as a service models, HPE is committed to technology reuse: 85% of the three million technology assets taken in from customers is reused. To help customers measure and manage their impact, HPEFS customers, and now selected partners’ customers1,can receive an HPE Circular Economy report that details how their IT assets were processed and the associated environmental savings from those services, which can be used for Scope 3 carbon disclosure reporting.

 Across its entire business, HPE works directly with customers to help them improve the efficiency and sustainability of their technology operations to meet their business needs. These uniquely customized engagements contributed to approximately $891 million in new net revenue for 2021, an increase of more than 185% in the last three years. In addition, in 2021, approximately 50% of HPE solutions had sustainability and efficiency attributes.

Building a diverse, engaged and inclusive culture

HPE continues to advance principles of diversity, equity and inclusion both within its workforce and beyond. In 2021, HPE met its annual target of increasing representation of both women and ethnically diverse talent. Representation of women in the workforce increased by 1% year-over-year, with increased representation at every level worldwide, exceeding goals in both technical and executive roles. HPE also increased representation of all underrepresented minorities in the U.S. by 1.6% overall.

 In 2022 HPE continued to make progress in its efforts to identify and address pay disparities that may impact women and underrepresented minorities. As a result, HPE is proud that women in the U.S., U.K. and India – representing a majority of our workforce footprint – earn $1.00 for every $1.00 earned by their male counterparts when accounting for legitimate business factors such as job title, time in role, experience and location. The same is true of underrepresented minorities in the U.S., and to the company intends to ensure the same level of progress throughout the rest of the world as it moves forward with future pay reviews.

Operating with the highest ethical standards

HPE’s commitment to winning the right way in the marketplace extends beyond our operations into the development, deployment and use of its products and solutions. One example is product security. HPE remains the only company offering Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (CNSA), the most advanced encryption for server platforms. In 2021, HPE introduced Project Aurora, which extends its secure root of trust and verification processes to deliver cloud-native, zero trust security to its edge-to-cloud architecture.

 Additionally, in 2021, HPE launched its Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics Principles to support the responsible development, deployment and use of artificial intelligence. These principles inform product development, partnerships, and the internal use of third-party AI to support business operations.

 HPE has also created more stringent supply chain responsibility targets in the last year to ensure its products are ethically sourced. By 2030, HPE aims for:
  

100% of HPE suppliers being committed to the employer pays principle in recruitment (98% of supplier spend)


100% of major HPE suppliers training their workers on human rights (95% of supplier spend)


100% of HPE tier 1 and 2 supplier sites having effective grievance processes for employees

Second quarter non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net EPS exclude after-tax adjustments of $333 million and $0.25 per diluted share, respectively, primarily for Russia related disaster charges, stock-based compensation expense, transformation costs, and the amortization of intangible assets.

Cash flow from operations of $379 million, down $443 million from the prior-year period.

Free cash flow of ($211) million, down $579 million from the prior-year period reflecting normal seasonality and strategic working capital actions due to strong customer demand.

Capital returns to shareholders of $214 million in the form of share repurchases and dividends.

Segment Results
  

Intelligent Edge revenue was $867 million, up 8% from the prior-year period in actual dollars and 9% when adjusted for currency, with 12.6% operating profit margin, compared to 15.7% in the prior-year period. Aruba Services revenue was up double-digits from the prior-year period and Intelligent Edge as-a-Service ARR4 was up 50%+ from the prior-year period.


High Performance Computing & Artificial Intelligence (“HPC & AI”) revenue was $710 million, up 4% from the prior-year period in actual dollars and 5% when adjusted for currency, with (5.6%) operating profit margin, compared to 2.6% from the prior-year period. The operating loss was driven by supply constraints and delayed customer acceptances.  We remain on track to exceed the expected 11% market CAGR from FY21-24.


Compute revenue was $3.0 billion, flat from the prior-year period in actual dollars and up 1% when adjusted for currency, with 13.9% operating profit margin, compared to 11.2% from the prior-year period.  Margin expansion was driven by strategic pricing actions more than offsetting input cost increases.


Storage revenue was $1.1 billion, down 3% from the prior-year period in actual dollars and 2% when adjusted for currency, with 12.6% operating profit margin, compared to 16.8% from the prior-year period reflecting higher supply chain costs and unfavorable mix shift.


Financial Services revenue was $823 million, down 2% from the prior-year period in actual dollars and flat when adjusted for currency, with 12.6% operating profit margin, compared to 10.8% from the prior-year period. Net portfolio assets of approximately $12.6 billion, down 4% from the prior-year period or up 1% when adjusted for currency. The business delivered return on equity of 20.4%, up 2.1 points from the prior-year period, well above pre-pandemic levels.

 
Dividend

Fiscal 2022 third quarter outlook:

Hewlett Packard Enterprise estimates GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.54. Fiscal 2022 third quarter non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude after-tax adjustments of approximately $0.22 per diluted share, primarily related to, transformation costs, stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of intangible assets.

Fiscal 2022 outlook:

Hewlett Packard Enterprise updates GAAP diluted net EPS outlook of $1.17 - $1.31 and full-year FY22 non-GAAP diluted net EPS outlook to the original outlook provided at our 2021 Securities Analyst Meeting of $1.96 to $2.10. Fiscal 2022 non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude after-tax adjustments of approximately $0.79 per diluted share, reflecting a charge related to Russia and Belarus, transformation costs, stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of intangible assets.

 4 Annualized Revenue Run-Rate (“ARR”) is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services (“CS”) offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income for capital leases), and software-as-a-Service, software consumption revenue, and other as-a-Service offerings recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it.

Use of non-GAAP financial information and key performance metrics

To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on a generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides financial measures, including revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, gross cash, free cash flow, net debt, net cash, operating company net debt and operating company net cash financial measures. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. A reconciliation of adjustments to GAAP financial measures for this quarter and prior periods is included in the tables below or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release. In addition, an explanation of the ways in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its business, the substance behind Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s decision to use these non-GAAP measures, the material limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures, the manner in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management compensates for those limitations, and the substantive reasons why Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors is included under “Use of non-GAAP financial measures” further below. This additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, gross profit, gross profit margin, operating profit (earnings from operations), operating profit margin, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, cash flow from operations, investments in property, plant and equipment, or total company debt prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 In addition to the supplemental non-GAAP financial information, Hewlett Packard Enterprise also presents annualized revenue run-rate (""ARR"") and as-a-Service (""AAS"") orders as performance metrics. ARR is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services (""CS"") offerings. ARR represents the annualized value of all recurring net HPE GreenLake services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income for operating leases and interest income for capital leases), and Software-as-a-Service (""SaaS""), software consumption revenue, and other as-a-Service offerings recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. AAS orders are an overlay across all business segments contributing to HPE's consumption-based services (both recurring and non-recurring revenues), and includes hardware, as well as HPE GreenLake as-a-Service, Aruba SaaS, CMS SaaS, and other Software assets. ARR & AAS orders should be viewed independently of net revenue and deferred revenue and are not intended to be combined with any of these items.

Use of non-GAAP financial measures

To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides financial measures including revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, gross cash, free cash flow, net debt, net cash, operating company net debt and operating company net cash financial measures. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to revenue on a constant currency basis is revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) is operating profit (earnings from operations). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin is operating profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income tax rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to gross cash is cash and cash equivalents. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow is cash flow from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net debt and operating company net debt is total company debt. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to each of net cash and operating company net cash is cash and cash equivalents. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are included in the tables above or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release.

Use and economic substance of non-GAAP financial measures used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise

Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges relating to the amortization of initial direct costs, stock-based compensation expense and disaster charges. Non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) and non-GAAP operating profit margin are defined to exclude any charges relating to the amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets, transformation costs, disaster charges, stock-based compensation expense and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges, as well as an adjustment to tax indemnification and related adjustments, non-service net periodic benefit credit, earnings from equity interests, certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of U.S. tax reform, structural rate adjustment and excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. In addition, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s historical and prospective financial performance, as well as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s performance relative to its competitors. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management also uses these non-GAAP measures to further its own understanding of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segment operating performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to better understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segments, as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. More specifically, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons:
 

Amortization of initial direct costs represents the portion of lease origination costs incurred in prior fiscal years that do not qualify for capitalization under the new leasing standard. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these costs as the Company elected the practical expedient under the new leasing standard. As a result, the Company did not adjust these historical costs to accumulated deficit. The Company believes that most financing companies did not elect this practical expedient and therefore the Company excludes these costs to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparisons to its peers.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions and any related impairment charges. Consequently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Transformation costs represent net costs related to the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan and HPE Next initiative and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to transform Hewlett Packard Enterprise's IT infrastructure and net gains from the sale of real-estate and any impairment charges on real-estate assets identified as part of the initiative.  Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating such expenses and gains for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s past operating performance.


Disaster charges primarily represent credit losses of financing receivables and trade receivables that may not be recoverable due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Disaster charges also include direct costs or recovery related to COVID-19 as a result of Hewlett Packard Enterprise-hosted, co-hosted, or sponsored event cancellations and shift to a virtual format. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating these amounts for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses, and such an exclusion facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs costs related to its acquisition, disposition and other related charges, most of which are treated as non-cash or non-capitalized expenses. The charges are direct expenses such as professional fees and retention costs. Charges may also include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal and arbitration settlements in connection with certain dispositions. Because non-cash or non-capitalized acquisition-related expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions and divestitures, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating such expenses for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s past operating performance.


Tax indemnification and related adjustments are primarily related to changes in certain pre-separation tax liabilities for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise was indemnified under the Termination and Mutual Release Agreement. These adjustments also include changes to certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise remains liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these income or charges and the associated tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Non-service net periodic benefit credit includes certain market-related factors such as (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains or losses, (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments and (vi) impacts from other market-related factors associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise's defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans. These market-driven retirement-related adjustments are primarily due to the change in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures and considers them to be outside the operational performance of the business.


Adjustment to earnings from equity interests includes the amortization of the basis difference in relation to the H3C divestiture and the resulting equity method investment in H3C. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating this amount for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise utilizes a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly related to the Company’s operating structure that can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, Hewlett Packard Enterprise evaluated a three-year financial projection. The projected rate assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year projection period and considers other factors including Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where Hewlett Packard Enterprise operates. For fiscal 2022, the Company will use a projected non-GAAP income tax rate of 14%, which reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP income tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. For fiscal 2021, the Company had a non-GAAP income tax rate of 14%. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that making these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures, facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.

 
Material limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are:
 

Amortization of initial direct cost and disaster charges are excluded from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, which can have an impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure and HPE Financial Services segment results.


Items such as stock-based compensation expense that is excluded from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


Amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s cash position, represents the loss in value of intangible assets over time. The expense associated with this loss in value is excluded from non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


Items such as transformation costs, and acquisition, and disposition and other related costs that are excluded from non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures and cash flow.


Items such as adjustment to non-service net periodic benefit credit and earnings from equity interests that are excluded from non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


Items such as tax indemnification and related adjustments, certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the related tax impacts from other non-GAAP measures that are excluded from the non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can also have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise may not be able to immediately liquidate the short-term and long-term investments included in gross cash, which may limit the usefulness of gross cash as a liquidity measure.


Free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period.


Other companies may calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share differently than Hewlett Packard Enterprise does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

 
Compensation for limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

Hewlett Packard Enterprise compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure within this news release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise encourages investors to review those reconciliations carefully.

Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors

Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that providing financial measures including revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, gross cash, free cash flow, net debt, net cash, operating company net debt and operating company net cash financial measures, to investors in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results “through the eyes” of management. Hewlett Packard Enterprise further believes that providing this information better enables Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s investors to understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance with the performance of other companies in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.

 The HPE GreenLake platform continues to drive strong customer demand.  In Q2 2022, HPE reported Annualized Revenue Run-Rate (ARR) of $829 million and triple digit as-a-service orders growth for the third consecutive quarter.

HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise

The market for private cloud continues to grow, due to multiple concerns and priorities for customers, including application entanglement, control, cost, data gravity, data latency, and predictability.

"Swedish cloud service provider, Datarewind, boosts hybrid office productivity with HPE cloud-native storage and enhanced compute capacities",2022-06-14,"IN THIS ARTICLE

Thanks to its performance and scalability, HPE Alletra was chosen to meet Datarewind’s increased demands for VDI
The new solution allows Datarewind to offer higher performance and quicker access to the work environment for its clients


STOCKHOLM, Sweden – June 14, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that Datarewind, a Swedish IT service provider, has selected HPE Alletra cloud-native data infrastructure and high-performing, versatile HPE ProLiant servers to host virtual machines on behalf of its clients. The new compute and data services solution allows Datarewind to offer higher performance and quicker access to the work environment for its clients, meeting the hybrid office demands of today while providing a strong foundation to easily adapt to future requirements.

Datarewind offers its services to clients across Sweden, allowing users to run VDI solutions during work hours and automate backup during the night. Due to the pandemic, demand for VDI solutions increased, and HPE Alletra was chosen to meet these increased demands thanks to its performance, scalability – and HPE’s existing track record as a supplier to Datarewind.

“The timing was right for an upgrade, with the added remote work demands that the pandemic created,” says Rickard Johansson, CEO of Datarewind. “We can now support about 100 concurrent customers working with graphically intense workloads from home. The new solution also enabled clients to run storage-heavy workloads, where HPE Alletra alleviated bottlenecks.”

With Datarewind also securing their clients’ data by way of backups, performance was of utmost importance in the choice of solution, as was modularity. With storage performance high enough to be limited by network bandwidth rather than storage throughput, the possibility to expand the storage pool was kept in mind when signing the deal.

“We were able to go from 10 on-site servers to two or three larger centralized ones. Both storage and automated tasks are running flawlessly. Tasks that previously took 40 minutes to execute now take five minutes,” says Johansson. “The future includes working from home, which Datarewind’s solutions are prepared for. Clients don’t require as many offices and can consolidate their workforce.”

HPE Sweden is also delighted to help Datarewind serve its clients better. The new HPE Alletra platform in use will allow Datarewind meet client SLAs and host more concurrent users than ever before. It also alleviates worries regarding VDI performance and minimizes downtime.

HPE Alletra is the cloud-native data infrastructure that powers data from edge-to-cloud. It features a portfolio of workload-optimized systems to deliver architectural flexibility to run any application without compromise.

“The HPE Alletra solution has enabled Datarewind to develop its new cloud offering and position itself better on the service provider market, with superior performance, high availability and scalability” comments Toni Drk Channel and Service Provider Sales Manager, HPE Sweden. “The HPE Alletra 6000 cloud native storage technology allows them to create a strong and attractive as-a-service offering for their clients.”

With the new solution in place, client satisfaction at Datarewind is reportedly at an all-time high. “The best part is when clients contact us about how happy they are with the new solution,” concludes Rickard Johansson.

Turk Nippon Insurance embarks on technology modernization with HPE GreenLake to boost performance,2022-06-23,"IN THIS ARTICLE

HPE GreenLake platform provided Turk Nippon Insurance with a unified operating experience that helped the company simplify and facilitate the IT infrastructure management
The acceleration of software projects enabled the organization to free up its resources and provide faster response to the growing consumer demands for personalized services


ISTANBUL, Turkey – June 23, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that Turk Nippon Insurance has future-proofed its IT infrastructure with the HPE GreenLake edge to cloud platform. After delivering insurance services for over 20 years, the company turned to HPE GreenLake to initiate a data-first modernization strategy to accelerate innovation and deliver superior customer experiences.

Turk Nippon Insurance was established in 1991 under the partnership of the Development Bank of Turkey and Nippon Fire & Marine Insurance and in 2008, it merged with the Harel Group, the largest insurance group in Israel. It became increasingly clear to the company that maintaining their aging legacy system was taking up a significant proportion of their IT budget. Additionally, the old IT environment no longer supported the company’s modern applications, and over time, it became more vulnerable to failures and therefore they needed to embark on an upgrade and modernization of their technology environment. 

“It is simply impossible to compete in the market when you have jumbled workflows and slow systems that are prone to error,” said Bahadır Gürgen, Information Security and System Infrastructure Manager at Turk Nippon Insurance. “By adopting HPE GreenLake, we’re not only modernizing our IT infrastructure for today but are signing up for a regular technology refresh to ensure we keep up with the demands of the business and meet the needs of our customers.” 

Besides boosting the company’s operational performance by 75%, HPE GreenLake platform provided Turk Nippon Insurance with a unified operating experience that helped the company simplify and facilitate the IT infrastructure management. The acceleration of software projects enabled the organization to free up its resources and provide faster response to the growing consumer demands for personalized services. Additionally, HPE GreenLake delivered seamless support for modern business and database applications, reducing poor data handling errors, saving the business precious time and costs of rectifying data errors.

“Turk Nippon Insurance knew that in order to compete in the market, they must adopt advanced technology that will win today and be ready for tomorrow,” said Cesminaz Demir, Account Manager at HPE. “As well as modernizing their existing environment, HPE GreenLake allowed Turk Nippon to avoid a large up-front investment and pay only for the resources they consume in a pay-per-use model. The flexible model also provides the company with on-demand IT scalability, adjusting to the lows and peaks of their yearly cycle.”

As part of HPE’s robust channel partner ecosystem for HPE GreenLake, BBS Enterprise provided extensive consulting and recommended the HPE GreenLake solution to support Turk Nippon Insurance’s needs. The HPE GreenLake solution runs on HPE SimpliVity, AI-driven hyperconverged architecture with machine learning analytics that delivers self-managing, self-optimizing, and self-healing infrastructure. The infrastructure also supports customer’s VMware virtualization solution designed for mission-critical enterprise computing.

“HPE GreenLake allows Turk Nippon Insurance to get faster access to the market, respond faster to the customers, make faster decisions, and get a return on investment – faster!” added Gökhan Kaya, Server, Storage and Cloud Solution Manager at BBS Enterprise.

Catharina Hospital selects HPE Ezmeral to power data-first modernization and improve accuracy and speed of diagnosis,2022-07-06,"IN THIS ARTICLE

Catharina Hospital will use HPE Ezmeral software to build a cloud-native analytics and data lakehouse to provide better treatment for patients
HPE Ezmeral will help Catharina Hospital to securely collect and analyze anonymized patient data from disparate sources across or outside of the hospital and accelerate model training



AMSTERDAM, Netherlands – July 6, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that Catharina Hospital, the largest hospital in the Netherlands’ Eindhoven region, providing care for over 150,000 patients, has selected the HPE Ezmeral software portfolio to build a cloud-native analytics and data lakehouse to provide more accurate diagnosis, early detection and injury prevention for patients.

Every year, approximately 40,000 patients are diagnosed with heart failure in the Netherlands. Heart disease can develop without any noticeable symptoms. Cardiologists hope that artificial intelligence can significantly contribute to the management of heart disease and provide better treatment for patients.

“The new data lakehouse that we’ve created using HPE Ezmeral will enable us to help accelerate model training and detect cardiogram anomalies among the 500,000 electrocardiograms (ECGs) already available for data analysis with higher precision and to identify the correct diagnosis and treatment,” said Thomas Mast from the cardiology department at Catharina Hospital. “The development of these algorithms based on artificial intelligence may deliver more accurate diagnoses and move toward a more preventative approach to patient care. This may also relieve some of the pressures on our healthcare system and ensures patient data remains in the hospital and is not moved to the public cloud.”

Like many other healthcare institutions, Catharina Hospital has faced tremendous pressure caring for patients throughout COVID-19, and has focused specifically on making better use of its existing data, leveraging it to gain insights that can improve patient care and drive better health outcomes. In order to accomplish this, the hospital looked to HPE Ezmeral ML Ops and HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics to create a single, central data lakehouse to securely collect and analyze anonymized patient data from disparate sources across or outside of the hospital and accelerate model training.

 The HPE Ezmeral open-source architecture also allows the hospital greater choice when selecting software because it can easily integrate with the HPE Ezmeral platform through the open-source Kubernetes and the growing number of validated ISV partners in the HPE GreenLake Marketplace, resulting in faster time-to-value.

 “HPE has been working with the hospital for a number of years to deliver technology solutions, and we are pleased with the smooth implementation of HPE Ezmeral to unite its disparate data sources into a single data lakehouse,” said Clemens Esser, Chief Technologist at HPE. “With this single, standardized data platform, the AI and data science teams within the hospital will be able to truly harness the value of their data and have a direct impact on improving patient care. The partnership is a common use case scenario for medical institutions across the world, and illustrates the strength of data innovations in the medical field.”

 Catharina Hospital joins a fast-growing number of enterprises spanning multiple industries turning to HPE Ezmeral for their analytics initiatives. The HPE Ezmeral software portfolio is a purpose-built, hybrid cloud platform for data science and analytics workloads for enterprises to build and accelerate their modern data analytics initiatives at scale. It is composed of a complete orchestrated Kubernetes container platform along with a built-in data fabric persistent storage layer and ML Ops for data science workflows. Today, the entire HPE Ezmeral portfolio,  HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise, HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics, HPE Ezmeral ML Ops, and HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric are available to customers globally, providing frictionless access to data edge to cloud.

McMaster University cracks genome sequencing to fight COVID-19 and other infectious diseases with Hewlett Packard Enterprise,2022-07-27,"IN THIS ARTICLE

The HPE solution was used during the COVID-19 pandemic to help monitor variants and support researchers investigating COVID-19 infections
The solution reduced the time to collect and analyze data from 9 to 10 hours to under an hour


ONTARIO, Canada – July 27, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that McMaster University’s McArthur Lab developed one of the fastest and most accurate software packages for determining COVID-19 variants, using the HPE Superdome Flex server to quickly ingest and process raw genomic data, unlock insights and help the world get ahead of virus mutations. The HPE solution was used effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic to help monitor variants and support researchers investigating COVID-19 infections by significantly reducing the time to collect and analyze data to sequence positive COVID-19 cases from typically nine to 10 hours to under an hour.

With researchers working to sequence raw genomic data, the team at McArthur Lab partnered with virologists at Ontario’s Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center to determine which viruses infect patients, and how pathogens evolve into new variants and spread between people. By working together at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, these two teams were the first in Canada to isolate the SARS-CoV-2 virus in January 2020 to study it. The information was shared with public health agencies and pharmaceutical companies to help develop vaccines and drugs.

“Like all other infectious disease labs, we looked at what was happening in Wuhan, China. And in the first two weeks after scientists there sequenced the genome of SARS-CoV-2, we redesigned our entire pipeline and built a platform to prepare for capturing the virus’s genes,” says Andrew McArthur, Ph.D., Professor in Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster University and member of the M.G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research (IIDR) and Canada's Global Nexus of Pandemics and Biological Threats. “You’ve got to have one-thousand-fold redundancy to figure out what’s infecting one patient when you’re doing genome assembly. So when you’ve got one hundred patients at a time, you’re rapidly approaching terabytes of information to compile, and you want it done in under an hour because the clinicians are calling to find out. The HPE solution reduced the time to collect and analyze data to sequence positive COVID-19 cases and accelerate decision-making.”

In addition to the HPE Superdome Flex server, which provides the world's most scalable and modular in-memory computing capabilities, McArthur Lab invested in other HPE solutions to store, compute and analyze a large volume of data. These solutions include:
 

HPE Nimble Storage HF20C to store vast amounts of raw genomic data coming in from sequencing teams.


HPE Apollo 6500 systems that are ideal for deep learning to develop AI algorithms to predict antibiotic failure based on bacterial genome sequence and to deploy machine learning to find new drugs.

 
“In genomics, technology plays a key role in DNA research to help predict, diagnose and treat diseases by providing researchers with high-performing computing to process large quantities of data at scale,” said Justin Hotard, executive vice president and general manager, HPC & AI, at HPE. “The impactful research that McMaster Lab contributed to the public is a tremendous example of how they used the computing capability of the HPE Superdome Flex to analyze massive data sets in real-time and provide timely answers to critical questions about COVID-19.” 

Long-term HPE authorized partners Arrow ESC Canada Ltd. and Compugen Inc. were instrumental in scoping and building the solution.

About McArthur Lab at McMaster University

The McArthur laboratory’s research program spans complex informatics approaches to the genomic surveillance of microbial drug resistance, development of biological databases, next-generation sequencing for genome assembly and molecular epidemiology, automated literature curation approaches, and controlled vocabularies for biological knowledge integration. A major part of their research program involves the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) which provides data standardization tools for genomic surveillance of drug-resistant bacterial pathogens, i.e. superbugs. CARD is now amongst the most widely used database for molecular surveillance of antimicrobial resistance across the globe, with over 4000 citations, over 2.7 million page views, and use of its algorithms to analyze the genome of a drug resistant infection once every 5 minutes. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic they took a leadership role in genomic surveillance and bioinformatics methods development to address SARS-CoV-2 variants within Canada, including development of Illumina sequencing bioinformatics workflow used by the Public Health Agency of Canada, genomic confirmation of isolation of the live virus, and provisioning SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data.

Use of non-GAAP financial measures

To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides financial measures including revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP R&D and FSC as a percentage of net revenue, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, gross cash, free cash flow, net debt, net cash, operating company net debt and operating company net cash financial measures. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow.

 These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to revenue on a constant currency basis is revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) is operating profit (earnings from operations). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin is operating profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP R&D and FSC as a percentage of net revenue is R&D and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income tax rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to gross cash is cash and cash equivalents. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow is cash flow from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net debt and operating company net debt is total company debt. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to each of net cash and operating company net cash is cash and cash equivalents. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are included in the tables above or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release.

Use and economic substance of non-GAAP financial measures used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise

Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges relating to the amortization of initial direct costs, stock-based compensation expense and disaster charges. Non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) and non-GAAP operating profit margin are defined to exclude any charges relating to the amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets, transformation costs, disaster charges, stock-based compensation expense and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges, as well as an adjustment to tax indemnification and related adjustments, non-service net periodic benefit credit, earnings from equity interests, certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of U.S. tax reform, structural rate adjustment and excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item. In addition, non-GAAP R&D and FSC exclude stock-based compensation expense.

 Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s historical and prospective financial performance, as well as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s performance relative to its competitors. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management also uses these non-GAAP measures to further its own understanding of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segment operating performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to better understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segments, as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. More specifically, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons:
 

Amortization of initial direct costs represents the portion of lease origination costs incurred in prior fiscal years that do not qualify for capitalization under the new leasing standard. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these costs as the Company elected the practical expedient under the new leasing standard. As a result, the Company did not adjust these historical costs to accumulated deficit. The Company believes that most financing companies did not elect this practical expedient and therefore the Company excludes these costs to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparisons to its peers.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions and any related impairment charges. Consequently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Transformation costs represent net costs related to the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan and HPE Next initiative and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to transform Hewlett Packard Enterprise's IT infrastructure, net gains from the sale of real-estate and any impairment charges on real-estate assets identified as part of the initiative.  Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating such expenses and gains for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s past operating performance.


Disaster charges are primarily related to the exit of the Company’s business in Russia and Belarus, and include credit losses of financing receivables and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned assets. Disaster charges also include direct costs or recovery related to COVID-19 as a result of Hewlett Packard Enterprise-hosted, co-hosted, or sponsored event cancellations and shift to a virtual format. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating these amounts for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses, and such an exclusion facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs costs related to its acquisition, disposition and other related charges, most of which are treated as non-cash or non-capitalized expenses. The charges are direct expenses such as professional fees and retention costs. Charges may also include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal and arbitration settlements in connection with certain dispositions. Because non-cash or non-capitalized acquisition-related expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions and divestitures, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating such expenses for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s past operating performance.


Tax indemnification and related adjustments are primarily related to changes in certain pre-separation tax liabilities for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise was indemnified under the Termination and Mutual Release Agreement. These adjustments also include changes to certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise remains liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these income or charges and the associated tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Non-service net periodic benefit credit includes certain market-related factors such as (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains or losses, (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments and (vi) impacts from other market-related factors associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise's defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans. These market-driven retirement-related adjustments are primarily due to the change in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures and considers them to be outside the operational performance of the business.


Adjustment to earnings from equity interests includes the amortization of the basis difference in relation to the H3C divestiture and the resulting equity method investment in H3C. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating this amount for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise utilizes a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly related to the Company’s operating structure that can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, Hewlett Packard Enterprise evaluated a three-year financial projection. The projected rate assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year projection period and considers other factors including Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where Hewlett Packard Enterprise operates. For fiscal 2022, the Company will use a projected non-GAAP income tax rate of 14%, which reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP income tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. For fiscal 2021, the Company had a non-GAAP income tax rate of 14%. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that making these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures, facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.

 
Material limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are:
 

Amortization of initial direct costs and disaster charges are excluded from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, which can have an impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure and HPE Financial Services segment results.


Items such as stock-based compensation expense that is excluded from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP R&D and FSC, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


Amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s cash position, represents the loss in value of intangible assets over time. The expense associated with this loss in value is excluded from non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


Items such as transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related costs that are excluded from non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures and cash flow.


Items such as adjustment to non-service net periodic benefit credit and earnings from equity interests that are excluded from non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


 Items such as tax indemnification and related adjustments, certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the related tax impacts from other non-GAAP measures that are excluded from the non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can also have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise may not be able to immediately liquidate the short-term and long-term investments included in gross cash, which may limit the usefulness of gross cash as a liquidity measure.


Free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period.


Other companies may calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP R&D and FSC as a percentage of net revenue, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share differently than Hewlett Packard Enterprise does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

 
Compensation for limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

Hewlett Packard Enterprise compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure within this news release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise encourages investors to review those reconciliations carefully.

Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors

Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that providing financial measures including revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP R&D and FSC as a percentage of net revenue, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, gross cash, free cash flow, net debt, net cash, operating company net debt and operating company net cash financial measures, to investors in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results “through the eyes” of management. Hewlett Packard Enterprise further believes that providing this information better enables Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s investors to understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance with the performance of other companies in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.

HOUSTON, Texas – October 19, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today hosted its annual Securities Analyst Meeting (“SAM”) at HPE’s headquarters in Houston, where Antonio Neri, president and chief executive officer, and Tarek Robbiati, executive vice president and chief financial officer, provided the financial outlook for fiscal year 2023 as well as details on the company’s strategy, customer trends, accelerating market opportunity, and long-term growth initiatives.

Neri emphasized in his SAM remarks how HPE’s edge-to-cloud strategy directly addresses IT industry megatrends that have emerged over the last several years. He noted that HPE has delivered strong results for shareholders and is in solid position to add even greater value. 

“We have taken decisive and important actions to transform HPE. Our evolution to a platform-based model, fueled by a software- and services-rich portfolio, is already delivering very strong results that translate to value for our shareholders,” Neri said. “Our distinct innovation and strong execution continue to drive customer demand across our portfolio, which we expect to result in higher recurring revenues, expanded gross and operating margins, and increased free cash flow in future years.”

 Neri illustrated additional market drivers that can accelerate greater success of HPE’s strategy, including the opportunity embedded in customers’ growing preference for hybrid multi-cloud models. “Hybrid multi-cloud adoption for the most demanding workloads is accelerating across industry verticals,” Neri said during the SAM webcast. “And while the world is already hybrid and getting more so, we know the cloud experience is not yet everywhere. Customers are looking for a way to unify their multi-generation IT strategy with a consistent cloud experience across all their applications and data.”

 Neri pointed to HPE’s leadership in hybrid multi-cloud, as the company that offers the broadest set of workloads of any hybrid cloud vendor in the market. “From the time we first predicted the future would be hybrid, we made sure we were first to bring to market differentiated services and solutions for our customers,” Neri said.

 Neri also provided updates on the maturity of the unique HPE GreenLake platform. HPE has distinguished the HPE GreenLake platform by providing a unified, automated, and secure cloud experience that is integrated across the edge, data centers, co-locations, and public clouds.

With more than 120,000 users across two million connected devices and $7.7 billion in total contract value, HPE GreenLake has driven traction across HPE’s overall portfolio. Total HPE orders, including as-a service bookings, are at their highest ever in the fiscal year 2022.

 “We are relentlessly focused on delivering customer-centric technology breakthroughs,” said Neri. “With the competitive advantages that our leadership position brings, HPE is poised to deliver on the commitments we have made.”

Financial Update

Tarek Robbiati provided more insight into how HPE’s vision is expected to translate into an attractive long-term financial profile.

 “We have the right edge-to-cloud strategy, aligned with dominant market trends and supported by a sound financial architecture to win customers, drive sustainable, profitable growth, and create shareholder value,” Robbiati said. “Our transition to as a service has helped us create resilient recurring revenue, higher gross margin, and sustainable free cash flow, enabling consistently strong top and bottom-line results, even in light of a complex macro environment.” 

 Robbiati also provided a financial update including the company’s outlook for fiscal year 2023, highlighting how HPE expects to capitalize on enduring market demand and detailing how various macroeconomic aspects factor into the outlook.

FY22 Expectations

HPE confirmed its previous fiscal year 2022 outlook. Revenue is expected to grow 3% to 4%, now adjusted 300 bps for currency versus 50 bps at the beginning of the fiscal year. Fiscal year 2022 GAAP diluted net earnings per share (EPS) to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.28 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $1.96 and $2.04. Fiscal 2022 non-GAAP diluted net EPS excludes after-tax costs of approximately $0.76 per share reflecting changes related to exiting Russia and Belarus, transformation costs, stock-based compensation, and amortization of intangible assets. Fiscal year 2022 free cash flow is expected to be between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion.

FY23 Outlook

HPE expects fiscal year 2023 financial results to continue the momentum from fiscal year 2022. The company expects its revenue growth to be 2% to 4%, when adjusted for currency, and non-GAAP operating profit growth of approximately 4% to 5% year-over-year. This excludes costs of approximately $0.86 billion primarily related to stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transformation costs. The company expects non-GAAP other income & expense of approximately $20 million to $40 million to be a net expense for the full year, excluding adjustments of approximately $40 million primarily related to non-service net periodic benefits. The company expects a non-GAAP tax rate of 14% based on current tax laws.

 HPE expects GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.38 to $1.46 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of between $1.96 and $2.04. The non-GAAP diluted net EPS outlook excludes after-tax costs of approximately $0.58 per share related primarily to stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transformation costs. HPE expects fiscal year 2023 free cash flow to be $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion.

Long-Term Financial Profile

HPE provided its long-term financial model for fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2025. The company expects its unique HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform will drive robust growth. HPE projects revenue growth of 2% to 4% adjusted for currency, led by healthy growth in Aruba and High Performance Computing & AI, and a compounded annual growth rate for annualized revenue run-rate1 of 35% to 45%.

 Additionally, it expects greater than $6.5 billion of cumulative free cash flow between fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2024, powered by sustained revenue growth, rising operating profits, and underpinned by strategic investments.

 The company will also prioritize a disciplined, returns-based capital allocation framework, which balances capital returns to shareholders and share repurchases with balanced investments for growth.

1 Annualized Revenue Run-Rate (ARR) is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services (CS) offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income for capital leases), and software-as-a-Service, software consumption revenue, and other as-a-Service offerings recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it.

Use of non-GAAP financial information and key performance metrics 

To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on a generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides forecasts of certain financial measures, including revenue adjusted for currency, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating profit growth, non-GAAP measure of other income and expenses, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, where available, are included in this release and the slides presented at the 2022 Securities Analyst Meeting, which will be available for a period of one year thereafter at www.hpe.com/investor/SAM2022. Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides certain guidance on a non-GAAP basis only, as the company cannot reasonably predict some elements that are included in reported GAAP results. Refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures below for more information. In addition, an explanation of the ways in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its business, the substance behind Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s decision to use these non-GAAP measures, the material limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures, the manner in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management compensates for those limitations, and the substantive reasons why Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors is included under “Use and economic substance of non-GAAP financial measures used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise” below. This additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, operating profit growth, diluted net earnings per share, other income and expenses, and cash flow from operations in accordance with GAAP.

Use and economic substance of non-GAAP financial measures used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s historical and prospective financial performance, as well as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s performance relative to its competitors. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management also uses these non-GAAP measures to further its own understanding of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segment operating performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to better understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segments, as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results.

Material limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

These non-GAAP financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results as reported under GAAP.

Compensation for limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

Hewlett Packard Enterprise compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as supplement. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measures to its most directly comparable GAAP measure in this release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise encourages investors to review carefully those reconciliations carefully.

Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors

Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that providing forecasts of revenue adjusted for currency, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating profit growth, non-GAAP measure of other income and expenses, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and free cash flow financial measures to investors, in addition to certain related GAAP measures, provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results “through the eyes” of management. Hewlett Packard Enterprise further believes that providing this information better enables Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s investors to understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance and financial condition and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to evaluate and measure such performance and financial condition. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance with the performance of other companies in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.

In addition to the supplemental non-GAAP financial information, Hewlett Packard Enterprise also presents annualized revenue run-rate (""ARR"") and as-a-Service (""AAS"") orders as performance metrics. ARR is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services (""CS"") offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income for operating leases and interest income from capital leases), and Software-as-a-Service (""SaaS""), software consumption revenue, and other as-a-Service offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. AAS orders are an overlay across all business segments contributing to HPE's consumption-based services (both recurring and non-recurring revenues), and includes hardware, as well as HPE GreenLake as-a-Service, Aruba SaaS, CMS SaaS, and other Software assets. ARR & AAS orders should be viewed independently of net revenue and deferred revenue and are not intended to be combined with any of these items.

(a) The Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $905 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as it was determined that the fair value of the HPC & AI and Software reporting units was below the carrying value of their net assets. Software is under the Corporate Investments and Other reportable segment.

(b) During the twelve months ended October 31, 2022, the Company recorded total pre-tax charges of $161 million primarily related to the Company's exit from its Russia and Belarus businesses. The charges primarily related to expected credit losses of financing and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned assets, $99 million of which was included in Financing cost, $12 million in Cost of services, and $50 million in Disaster charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. During the twelve months ended October 31, 2022, Disaster charges also included a recovery of $2 million, related to COVID-19.

(c) Represents the amortization of basis difference adjustments related to the H3C divestiture.

(d) Diluted net earnings per share reflects any dilutive effect of restricted stock awards, stock options and performance based awards, but the effect is excluded when calculating GAAP diluted net (loss) per share because it would be anti-dilutive.

Use of non-GAAP financial measures

To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides financial measures including revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP R&D and FSC as a percentage of net revenue, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, gross cash, free cash flow, net debt, net cash, operating company net debt and operating company net cash financial measures. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to revenue on a constant currency basis is revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) is operating profit (earnings from operations). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin is operating profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP R&D and FSC as a percentage of net revenue is R&D and SG&A expense as a percentage of net revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income tax rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to gross cash is cash and cash equivalents.  The GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow is cash flow from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net debt and operating company net debt is total company debt. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net cash and operating company net cash is cash and cash equivalents. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are included in the tables above or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release.

Use and economic substance of non-GAAP financial measures used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise

Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges relating to the amortization of initial direct costs, stock-based compensation expense and disaster charges. Non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), and non-GAAP operating profit margin are defined to exclude any charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, amortization of initial direct costs, impairment of goodwill, transformation costs, disaster charges, stock-based compensation expense and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges, as well as an adjustment to earnings from equity interests, non-service net periodic benefit credit, litigation judgment, early debt redemption costs, tax indemnification and related adjustments, certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform and excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item. In addition, non-GAAP R&D and FSC exclude stock-based compensation expense.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s historical and prospective financial performance, as well as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s performance relative to its competitors. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management also uses these non-GAAP measures to further its own understanding of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segment operating performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to better understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segments, as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. More specifically, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons:
 

Amortization of initial direct costs represents the portion of lease origination costs incurred in prior fiscal years that do not qualify for capitalization under the new leasing standard. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these costs as the Company elected the practical expedient under the new leasing standard. As a result, the Company did not adjust these historical costs to accumulated deficit. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that most financing companies did not elect this practical expedient and therefore the Company excludes these costs to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparisons to its peers.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions and any related impairment charges. Consequently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Hewlett Packard Enterprise recorded an impairment charge for the goodwill associated with its HPC & AI and Software reporting units following the annual goodwill impairment review. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods


Transformation costs represent net costs related to the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan and HPE Next initiative and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to transform Hewlett Packard Enterprise's IT infrastructure, net gains from the sale of real estate and any impairment charges on real-estate identified as part of the initiative. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating such expenses and gains for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s past operating performance.


Disaster charges are primarily related to the exit of the Company’s businesses in Russia and Belarus, and include credit losses of financing receivables and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned assets. Disaster charges also include direct costs or recovery related to COVID-19 as a result of Hewlett Packard Enterprise-hosted, co-hosted, or sponsored event cancellations and shift to a virtual format. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating these amounts for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses and such an exclusion facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs costs related to its acquisition, disposition and other related charges, most of which are treated as non-cash or non-capitalized expenses. The charges are direct expenses such as professional fees and retention costs. Charges may also include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal and arbitration settlements in connection with certain dispositions. Because non-cash or non-capitalized acquisition-related expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions and divestitures, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating such expenses for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s past operating performance.


Adjustment to earnings from equity interests includes the amortization of the basis difference in relation to the H3C divestiture and the resulting equity method investment in H3C. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating this amount for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Non-service net periodic benefit credit includes certain market-related factors such as (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains or losses, (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments and (vi) impacts from other market-related factors associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise's defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans. These market-driven retirement-related adjustments are primarily due to the change in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures and considers them to be outside the operational performance of the business.


In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, following the conclusion of litigation proceedings, Hewlett Packard Enterprise received $2.35 billion from a litigation judgment. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes this gain for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurred early debt redemption costs of $100 million relating to the early redemption of 4.65% Senior Notes with an original maturity date of October 1, 2024. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Tax indemnification and related adjustments are primarily related to changes in certain pre-separation tax liabilities for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise was indemnified under the Termination and Mutual Release Agreement. These adjustments also include changes to certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise remains liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these income or charges and the associated tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise utilizes a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly related to the Company’s operating structure that can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, Hewlett Packard Enterprise evaluated a three-year financial projection. The projected rate assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year projection period, and considers other factors including Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where Hewlett Packard Enterprise operates. For fiscal 2022, the Company used a projected non-GAAP income tax rate of 14%, which reflected current available information as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP income tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. For fiscal 2021, the Company had a non-GAAP tax rate of 14%. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that making these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.


Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as cash flow from operations, excluding the impact of proceeds received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 from a one-time litigation judgment, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant & equipment (“PP&E”) less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. HPE’s management uses free cash flow for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in HPE’s businesses, repurchasing stock and other purposes. HPE’s management also uses free cash flow to evaluate HPE’s historical and prospective liquidity. Because free cash flow represents cash flow from operations, excluding the impact of proceeds received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 from a one-time litigation judgment, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant & equipment (“PP&E”) less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, HPE believes that free cash flow provides a more accurate and complete assessment of HPE’s liquidity and capital resources.

 
Material limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are:
 

Amortization of initial direct costs and disaster charges are excluded from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, which can have an impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure and HPE Financial Services segment results.


Items such as stock-based compensation expense that is excluded from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP R&D and FSC, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


Amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s cash position, represents the loss in value of intangible assets over time. The expense associated with this loss in value is excluded from non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


 Items such as impairment of goodwill, transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related costs that are excluded from non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures and cash flow.


Items such as adjustment to earnings from equity interests, non-service net periodic benefit credit, litigation judgment, and early debt redemption costs that are excluded from non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


Items such as tax indemnification and related adjustments, certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the related tax impacts from other non-GAAP measures that are excluded from the non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can also have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise may not be able to immediately liquidate the short-term and long-term investments included in gross cash, which may limit the usefulness of gross cash as a liquidity measure.


Free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period.


Other companies may calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP R&D and FSC as a percentage of net revenue, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and free cash flow differently than Hewlett Packard Enterprise does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

 
Compensation for limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

Hewlett Packard Enterprise compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure within this news release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise encourages investors to review those reconciliations carefully.

Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors

Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that providing financial measures including revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP R&D and FSC as a percentage of net revenue, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, gross cash, free cash flow, net debt, net cash, operating company net debt and operating company net cash financial measures to investors in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results “through the eyes” of management. Hewlett Packard Enterprise further believes that providing this information better enables Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s investors to understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance with the performance of other companies in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.

As an official supplier to the 2023 Ryder Cup, HPE will deliver an intelligent, secure and high-performance wired and wireless network platform
As-a-service solutions, through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, will reduce the time and cost of setting up the venue, while delivering an automated and secure cloud-based connectivity experience


Frankfurt, Germany – December 7, 2022 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced a partnership with the 2023 Ryder Cup to deliver its cutting-edge technologies at one of the world’s largest sporting events. As an Official Supplier to the 2023 Ryder Cup, HPE will deliver an intelligent, secure and high-performance wired and wireless network platform at the prestigious golf event being held at Marco Simone Golf & Country Club in Rome, Italy, in September 2023.

Held biannually since 1927 featuring teams from Europe and the USA, the event attracts more than 250,000 onsite spectators and more than 600 million global television viewers. With each installment of the Ryder Cup taking place at a different venue covering hundreds of acres, typically in rural locations, staging the event introduces unique technological challenges. A golf course that normally caters for dozens of visitors at any one time will become one of the largest temporary sports stadiums in the world. As-a-service solutions, through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, will reduce the time and cost of setting up the venue, while delivering an automated and secure cloud-based connectivity experience.

“We have a bold ambition to create one of the most intelligent, immersive and sustainable temporary-constructed sporting venues in the world,” said Michael Cole, chief technology officer of the European Tour group. “We look forward to working together with HPE to unlock the value of data to provide a level of spectator engagement never before witnessed at a sporting event.

"Lack of data capabilities impedes organizations’ success, global survey finds",2022-12-07,"IN THIS ARTICLE

Global survey provides a detailed view of the strategic, organizational and technological gaps that organizations must close to leverage data as a strategic asset
Majority of respondents (62%) say it’s strategically important for their organizations to control their data and the means to create value from data
Closing the capability gaps requires a shift in organizations’ transformation strategies


FRANKFURT, Germany – December 7, 2022 – While governments around the world have identified data as a strategic resource to drive economic and social progress 1, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today unveiled global survey results showing that a lack of data maturity hinders both the private and public sector from achieving key outcomes such as growing sales or advancing environmental sustainability.

 Conducted by YouGov on behalf of HPE, the survey of more than 8,600 decision makers from across industries and the public sector in 19 countries reveals that the average organization’s data maturity level – or ability to create value from data – is 2.6 on a five-point scale, with only three percent reaching the highest maturity level.

 “There is broad consensus that the world’s data holds an enormous potential to advance the way we live and work – however, unlocking this potential requires a shift in organizations’ digital transformation strategies,” said Antonio Neri, president and CEO of HPE. “We must move from ‘cloud first’ to ‘data first’ as the North Star of digital transformation – meaning that organizations align their strategic, organizational and technological choices with the overarching goal of leveraging data as a strategic asset.”

Lack of data capabilities impedes key outcomes

The survey is based on a maturity model developed by HPE that assesses an organization’s ability to create value from data based on strategic, organizational and technological criteria. The lowest maturity level 1 is called “data anarchy”; on this level, data pools are isolated from one another, and are not systematically analyzed to create insights or outcomes. The highest level (5) is called “data economics”; at this level, an organization strategically leverages data to drive outcomes, based on a unified access to both internal and external data sources which are analyzed with advanced analytics and artificial intelligence.

Survey results reveal that 14 percent of organizations are on maturity level 1 (“data anarchy”), 29 percent on level 2 (“data reporting”), 37 percent on level 3 (“data insights”), 17 percent on level 4 (“data centricity”), and just 3 percent are on level 5 (“data economics”).

The lack of data capabilities, in turn, limits organizations’ ability to create key outcomes such as growing sales (30%), innovating (28%), advancing customer experience (24%), improving environmental sustainability (21%) and increasing internal efficiency (21%).

Organizations must close strategic, organizational and technological gaps

The survey provides a detailed view of the strategic, organizational and technological gaps that organizations must close to capitalize on data along their entire value chain. Sample findings include: 


Only 13 percent of respondents say that their organization’s data strategy is a key part of their corporate strategy.


Almost half of respondents say their organization allocates either no budget for data initiatives (28%) or only occasionally funds data initiatives via the IT budget (20%).
Only 28 percent of respondents confirmed they have a strategic focus on providing data-driven products or services.


And almost half of respondents say their organizations do not use methodologies like machine learning or deep learning but rely on spreadsheets (29%) or business intelligence and canned reporting (18%) for data analysis.
  

Creating value from data also requires aggregating data or data insights from different applications, locations or external data spaces. For example, a manufacturer’s sensor telemetry from sold products can help the R&D department to better align the next product generation with customer needs, and sharing insights from patient data among hospitals can advance medical diagnosis.

Organizations want control across clouds and edges

A characteristic of a low data maturity level is that there is no overarching data and analytics architecture, but data is isolated in individual applications or locations. This is the case for 34 percent of respondents. On the other hand, only 19 percent have implemented a central data hub or fabric that provides unified access to real-time data across their organization, and another 8 percent say this data hub also includes external data sources.

 Given that data sources are increasingly distributed across clouds and edges, the majority of respondents (62%) say that it’s strategically important to have a high degree of control over their data and the means to create value from data. More than half of respondents (53%) are concerned that data monopolies have too much control over their capability to create value from data, and 39 percent are re-evaluating their cloud strategy due to increasing cloud costs (42%), concerns over data security (37%), the need for a more flexible data architecture (37%) and the lack of control over their data (32%).

HPE GreenLake brings the cloud to the data to maximize control and outcomes

HPE’s strategy is focused on helping organizations accelerate outcomes by unlocking value from all of their data, regardless of where it lives. The HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform enables customers to deploy a cloud-everywhere model with the freedom to choose the right location for their data and applications while providing one operating model to orchestrate across edges, colocations, data centers, and clouds. As a result, customers can control their data assets and industrialize their data supply chain through a unified data fabric that empowers analysis and decision making at speed.

 “Because of the massive growth of data at the edge, organizations need hybrid edge-to-cloud architectures where the cloud comes to the data, not the other way around. HPE GreenLake empowers organizations with the ability to access, control, protect, govern and unlock the value of data anywhere, unified into one consistent experience,” added Neri.

 Today, HPE bolstered its hybrid cloud leadership by announcing new application, analytics, and developer services for HPE GreenLake that enable organizations to drive a data-first modernization strategy for production workloads across hybrid cloud environments.

Research Methodology

The data is based on an online survey conducted by YouGov between October 26 and November 18, 2022, among C-level executives, business unit and function leaders, department and division leaders, first-line managers and team leaders across industries and the public sector in Australia (N = 500), Brazil (N = 500), Canada (N = 500), France (N = 500), Germany (N = 500), India (N = 500), Italy (N = 500), Japan (N = 400), Mexico (N = 500), Netherlands (N = 500), Poland (N = 500), Singapore (N = 500), Spain (N = 200), South Korea (N = 400), Sweden (N = 200), Switzerland (N = 200), Türkiye (N = 200), UK (N = 500), US (N = 1000). 

1 For example, European Commission’s data strategy calls data the “lifeblood of economic development“, the UK government in its National Data Strategy calls data the “the great opportunity of our time”, the U.S. Federal Government has laid out a strategy and action plan to “leverage data as a strategic asset”, and the Communist Party of China has declared data to be a factor of production.

"Brazil’s largest medical cooperative from Santa Catarina selects HPE GreenLake to drive innovation, transform patient outcomes and extend reach of healthcare services",2023-01-30,"IN THIS ARTICLE

Unimed Grande Florianópolis has chosen the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform to accelerate innovation and deliver new digital touchpoints and services to healthcare patients across the country
HPE worked in partnership with partner, Sercompe to build the system tailored to the unique needs of Brazil's healthcare system


Florianópolis, Brazil – January 30, 2023 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that Unimed Grande Florianópolis, a branch of the Brazil’s largest medical cooperative group, has chosen the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform to accelerate innovation and deliver new digital touchpoints and services to healthcare patients across the country.

 Unimed Grande Florianópolis – known widely as Unimed Floripa - is a cooperative providing healthcare services within the Santa Catarina state in Brazil. It is the largest of its kind in the country, serving more than 220,000 people in 17 cities, across 20 hospitals, 270 clinics, 90 medical labs, and 1,700 medical doctors.  The healthcare system in Brazil was severely impacted by the demands from the pandemic and struggled to cope with the surge in admissions and demand for services. The cooperative needed to rethink the way it was delivering healthcare and accelerated its digital transformation plans to create new digital touchpoints for patients and extend the reach of healthcare provision. To do this it needed to modernize its existing technology environment to support the implementation of new projects, digitize patient records and simplify the sharing of critical data among different healthcare teams.

 Unimed Grande Florianópolis reimagined its IT around the HPE GreenLake platform to create a scalable, agile, high performance private cloud with a pay-per-use financial model.  HPE GreenLake delivers a single technology environment across all facets of care, from appointment management to patient record access. Its pay-per-use structure ensures that Unimed Grande Florianópolis and its service users get maximum value from their investment and maximum reliability from a single management interface, and a scalable unified solution. 

“The performance improvement is undeniable,” said Leandro Morales, IT Infrastructure Specialist at Unimed Grande Florianópolis.  “With HPE GreenLake we’ve also seen a significant leap in project activity with a much faster response to new projects and ideas.  Previously provisioning new resources could take days and now this can be done in five minutes. It’s a far more agile way of working.”

 One example of a new way of working is Doctor-U, a network of telemedicine kiosks. The kiosks, open 24/7, enable patients to contact a doctor and register a range of health indicators, including BMI, blood pressure and heart rate. All interactions with Doctor-U are logged on a patient’s health record. Many of the tasks are conducted via an AI-powered virtual doctor. The plan is to roll out the kiosks state-wide, helping relieve the burden on medical staff, and as a triage for more serious complaints.  Another example is a patient app providing access to medical records and appointments, so that medical teams have access to the information they need to work remotely.

 In addition to the cost-optimization of pay-per-use, the new environment has also significantly reduced electrical power and space requirements to further reduce overheads at a time when cost is a significant factor in healthcare delivery. 

“We are thrilled to have been able to design a system that meets the specific and exacting needs of a leading healthcare provider like Unimed Grande Florianópolis,” said Ricardo Emmerich, managing director, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Brazil. “We embarked on the project knowing that we needed to offer maximum reliability in a challenging financial framework and thanks to HPE GreenLake, we are proud to be a part of improving patient outcomes across Unimed’s healthcare network.”

 HPE worked in partnership with HPE authorized partner, Sercompe to build the system tailored to the unique needs of Brazil's healthcare system. The HPE GreenLake platform runs VMware and is delivered through a combination of HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen 10 servers, HPE Alletra dHCI and HPE FlexFabric 5710 Switches.

The HPE GreenLake platform will enable CEF to optimize their infrastructure management and improve security using the disaster recovery capabilities of Zerto
With the implementation of the HPE GreenLake platform in the UK, CEF now has a global platform that can easily be deployed and replicated with a single user experience throughout all their regions, including North America, Ireland, Spain and Australia


London, UK – January 26, 2023 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that City Electrical Factors (CEF), the United Kingdom’s leading electrical wholesale network, has selected the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform as the first step in its digital transformation journey. The HPE GreenLake platform will enable CEF to optimize their infrastructure management and improve security using the disaster recovery capabilities of Zerto.

Established in 1951, CEF prides itself on delivering optimal customer service and satisfaction. CEF’s customer platform, which enables them to respond to and track orders of all sizes, was based on legacy technology and had become outdated. To improve the customer experience, CEF decided to move to a cloud experience with the HPE GreenLake platform. As part of the solution the wholesaler will move into global International Business Exchangeä (IBXâ) data centers operated by HPE partner Equinix, benefitting from HPE Datacenter Technology Services to plan, design and deploy the solution.

This move will provide the company with a cloud experience that allows them to scale on demand and pay as they use. CEF will also simplify their infrastructure management experience using HPE GreenLake Management Services and ensure their business continuity with Zerto for Disaster Recovery. With the implementation of the HPE GreenLake platform in the UK, CEF now has a global platform that can easily be deployed and replicated with a single user experience throughout all their regions, including North America, Ireland, Spain and Australia.

“We’ve enjoyed a long-standing partnership with HPE for the past 15 years, and we are delighted to continue this journey utilizing the HPE GreenLake platform,” said Jon Higginson, IT EMEA Director at CEF. “We were looking to improve our service offering to our customers through the adoption of cloud technologies and we found the HPE GreenLake platform to be the most compelling offer available. As we operate over 400 stores globally, we need to ensure that we have a consistent platform that delivers an ongoing positive customer experience, scales as we grow and provides the flexibility to be tailored to potential future requirements. The disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities of Zerto in particular will deliver the enhanced stability and reliability we seek for our operations.”

When researching a new solution to drive their transformation, CEF focused on systems that would enable them in their journey to the cloud, enhance their security and strengthen their customer relationships. Key requirements were to increase the company’s protection against cyber threats and external disruptions, ensure the continuity of high quality of customer service, and the reduction of energy consumption and thereby of the group’s carbon footprint. At the same time, it was important for the services to be deployable and replicable throughout the different regions CEF operates in. 

“Running the HPE GreenLake platform in a colocation is the ideal solution for customers like CEF, who are looking for a cloud experience while staying in full control of their IT,” said Matt Harris, managing director UK, HPE. “As a partner first organization, we’re delighted to work with Equinix, the HPE GreenLake Momentum Partner of the Year 2022, to enable CEF to access the hybrid cloud services they require, wherever and whenever they need them. Not only does this give CEF the control over their usage and cost, but it also allows them to free up more of their time that can be further invested into their transformation efforts.”

With the deployment of HPE GreenLake Management Services, CEF will entrust the managing of its infrastructure stack to HPE. By reducing the time spent on management, about 20% of the CEF IT team’s time will be freed up. This additional time will allow the group to enhance their offerings and address their customer’s needs and requirements and accelerate their cloud journey in additional regions. HPE GreenLake also allows them to migrate their bespoke applications to a hybrid cloud platform designed for both cloud-native and legacy workloads.

HPE GreenLake and Zerto will give CEF peace of mind, as it ensures close to zero downtime and allows them to move production workloads quickly into the disaster recovery environment. As part of the disaster recovery environment, the group will reduce the recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) from 24 hours down to minutes. This ensures internal and external end users stay unaffected and allows their business to continue trading. After the initial roll-out of HPE GreenLake with Zerto at their DR site in the UK, CEF is planning to deploy HPE GreenLake in Australia as well as their production site in the UK.

 By integrating Pachyderm’s machine learning pipeline capabilities with its existing AI offerings, HPE will enable faster development and deployment of more accurate and performant large-scale AI applications with the following benefits:
 

Data lineage – Visibility on the origin of the data and where it moves over time during the machine learning lifecycle and analytics process to easily trace errors back to the root cause.


Data versioning – Ability to track different versions of data to understand when data was created or changed at any point in time, to increase efficiency in making any changes.


Efficient incremental data processing – As data changes over time, only incremental data needs to be processed to update AI applications. Pachyderm makes incremental data processing automatic and efficient.

 
Lockheed Martin deploys HPE’s AI at-scale solutions for mission-critical applications

Lockheed Martin’s AI Factory, an open architecture approach to AI-at-scale, integrates Pachyderm’s software, the HPE Machine Learning Development Environment, and other modular solutions as part of their foundational AI ecosystem. Leveraging these capabilities allows Lockheed Martin to increase trust, maximize performance, and standardize AI technologies across a broad range of contested environments in support of national security missions.

 This acquisition builds on HPE’s February 2022 investment in Pachyderm through its venture capital arm, Hewlett Packard Pathfinder, to speed time-to-market for AI innovation at lower data processing and operating costs. The transaction is not subject to any regulatory approvals and is expected to close this month.

Product integration and availability

Pachyderm’s software is available today to integrate with HPE’s existing supercomputing and AI software solutions. Additionally, HPE plans to integrate Pachyderm with upcoming versions of the HPE Machine Learning Development System, which eliminates the complexity and cost to build and train models with a complete, ready-to-use solution.

"Hewlett Packard Enterprise doubles down on private 5G, extends leadership in wireless connectivity with acquisition of Athonet ",2023-02-23,"IN THIS ARTICLE

HPE is acquiring private cellular technology provider Athonet to expand our overall private 5G offerings to both enterprises and communication service providers
The combination of Aruba+Athonet now gives us the most complete private 5G and Wi-Fi portfolio in the market, and puts HPE at the forefront of a growing private 5G market that IDC predicts to grow to $1.6B annually by 2026


HOUSTON, Texas – February 23, 2023 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced the expansion of its connected edge-to-cloud offering with the acquisition of Athonet, a private cellular network technology provider that delivers mobile core networks to enterprises and communication service providers. Combined with the HPE telco and Aruba networking portfolios, Athonet will put HPE at the forefront of a growing market that is predicted by IDC to increase to more than $1.6 billion1 by 2026.

Based in Vicenza, Italy, Athonet has more than 15 years of experience delivering 4G and 5G mobile core solutions to customers and partners globally. Athonet is an award-winning technology pioneer with more than 450 successful customer deployments in various industries, including leading mobile operators, hospitals, airports, transportation ports, utilities, government and public safety organizations.

With enterprises facing complex connectivity challenges across large and remote sites, private 5G offers high levels of coverage, reliability and mobility across campus and industrial environments. It also augments the cost-effective, high-capacity connectivity provided by Wi-Fi. The incorporation of Athonet’s technology will allow HPE to deliver private networking capabilities directly to enterprises as part of HPE’s Aruba networking portfolio, while also enabling communications service providers (CSPs) to quickly deploy private 5G networks for their customers.

“Telco customers are looking for simpler ways to deploy private 5G networks to meet growing customer expectations at the connected edge,” said Tom Craig, global vice president and general manager, Communications Technology Group at HPE. “At the same time, enterprise customers are demanding a customized 5G experience with low-latency, segregated resources, extended range and security across campus and industrial environments that complement their existing wireless networks. With the acquisition of Athonet, HPE now has one of the most complete private 5G and Wi-Fi portfolios for CSP and enterprise customers – and we will offer it as a service through HPE GreenLake.”

HPE expands private 5G solutions for both telcos and the enterprise

HPE will integrate Athonet’s technology into its existing CSP and Aruba networking enterprise offerings to create a private networking portfolio that accelerates digital transformation from edge-to-cloud. The networking portfolio will provide the following benefits:
 

Enhanced private networks that combine the high capacity of Wi-Fi with the coverage and mobility of 5G


Accelerated private 5G deployments that improve agility and innovation to help telco B2B teams and enterprise customers


New enterprise revenue streams for telcos with differentiated services leveraging 5G and Wi-Fi


Alignment of costs to revenues with consumption-based models for enterprises and telcos through HPE GreenLake, reducing the risk of entering new markets


Management of operational complexity and cost efficiency with 5G orchestration and zero-touch automation to deliver new workloads from edge-to-cloud



With 5G investments running into the billions of dollars, CSPs are looking for simple ways to meet customer needs and drive new B2B revenue by deploying both edge compute and private 5G networks. The addition of Athonet’s software to HPE’s telco portfolio enhances one of the broadest communications portfolios in the market, which serves a base of more than 300 customers across 160 countries and connects more than one billion mobile devices worldwide. Building on its existing private 5G solutions, HPE’s enhanced offering for CSPs will support private 4G and 5G networks and include telco-grade orchestration and automation capabilities. These capabilities will help launch new B2B services that meet growing customer expectations for the connected edge. 

“Athonet was founded to provide customers with private 4G and 5G solutions that deliver carrier-grade reliability and performance to suit their increasing and more challenging connectivity needs,” said Gianluca Verin, CEO and co-founder of Athonet. “We are excited to join HPE and combine our highly skilled teams as we expand our joint service provider offerings for the rapidly growing private 5G market and build on HPE’s strategy to be the leading edge-to-cloud solutions provider.”

Private 5G offers enterprises new capabilities that are ultra-secure, easy to deploy and manage, ready for highly specialized applications such as robotics and industrial IoT, data networks and pipelines, and security systems facilitation. The acquisition of Athonet strengthens Aruba’s connected edge portfolio, providing the unique and highly sought-after ability to deliver fully integrated Wi-Fi and private 5G networks. Integration with Aruba Central will enable network managers to administer Wi-Fi and private 5G through a single pane of glass and bring to bear the power of AI-powered insights, workflow automation, and robust security.

HPE GreenLake, HPE’s edge-to-cloud platform, will offer Athonet private 5G offerings, combining all costs for Wi-Fi and private 5G into one single monthly subscription with no capital expenditure. Flexible consumption options, including HPE’s networking as a service, mean private 5G networks can be deployed with reduced risk, little upfront investment and scaled according to demand.

HPE portfolio integration and availability

HPE will integrate Athonet’s solutions with its existing telco software assets and plans to make them available to customers some time following the close of the transaction. HPE will also integrate the solutions with the Aruba networking portfolio in the near future. The transaction is expected to close at the beginning of the third quarter of HPE’s 2023 fiscal year, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

OL Groupe selects HPE GreenLake to support its energy efficiency plan and improve the visitor and fan experience,2023-02-21,"IN THIS ARTICLE

HPE's solution cuts the energy footprint of OL Groupe's data centers in half and helps it meet its energy efficiency commitments to reduce its power consumption by 20% each year
HPE's solution based on HPE ProLiant and HPE Alletra multiplies by four the performance of the data center hosted in the Groupama Stadium, owned by OL Groupe


PUTEAUX – February 21, 2023 - Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that OL Groupe has selected the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform to modernize its entire on-premises infrastructure. The HPE solution enables OL Groupe to increase its agility to deploy IT resources, reduce its environmental footprint and accelerate the development of its new entertainment offerings to its millions of fans worldwide.

The OL Group owns the Olympique Lyonnais professional soccer club and operates its own stadium, the Groupama Stadium, located in Décines-Charpieu, 365 days a year. The group operates in many domains such as soccer and other major sports events and entertainment. The group needed to evolve its technology environment and meet the very strong requirements of these activities in terms of availability, agility, security, resilience, and profitability.

A flexible architecture to meet the group's new offers

As part of the renewal of its equipment, OL Groupe called on HPE and its partner Cheops Technology to design and deploy a modern and resilient on-premises technology platform, distributed over two data centers hosted within the Groupama Stadium, in order to respond to the rapid development of new services, while allowing better cost management.

This new platform, delivered on a pay-per-use basis with HPE GreenLake and managed from a single cloud interface, leverages HPE Alletra cloud-native data infrastructure and HPE ProLiant high-performance general-purpose servers.

The main missions of this new software-defined platform are to:
 

Ensure business continuity 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, via a rapid disaster recovery solution running on two separate data centers and capable of providing greater resiliency, including HPE data protection solutions and HPE StoreOnce backup appliances that support all stadium data streams.


Improve visitor safety in the stadium, with expanded computing and storage capabilities for better management of video surveillance devices and higher image definition.


Improve performance, to support the development of OL Groupe activities and the multiplication of public events, concerts, sports and esports competitions, especially during the operation phase of the future LDLC Arena, owned by OL Group, by the end of 2023.


Control its environmental impact by using an efficient and flexible on-premises technology platform to avoid over-provisioning while cutting energy costs in half.


Addressing environmental issues through technology

As the first French League 1 soccer club to be awarded a label certifying its action for the preservation of the environment1 , Olympique Lyonnais reaffirms its commitment to the environmental cause by choosing the HPE GreenLake solution. This solution has enabled OL Groupe to reduce the energy cost of its IT structure by nearly 50% and is helping it to achieve its bold objective of reducing its energy footprint by 20% each year.

Specifically, the new HPE infrastructure and services delivered by CHEOPS TECHNOLOGY have enabled the group to increase its computing capacity fourfold and improve its storage, all while reducing the demand on resources to power and cool it and ensuring that additional capacity is always available.

""The continuation of our collaboration with HPE allows us to fully enter the concrete phase of our energy efficiency plan, with the objective of reducing our energy consumption by 20% while guaranteeing the continuation of our sports and entertainment activities,"" said Emmanuelle Sarrabay, Deputy Director General for Finance and Information Systems and Corporate Legal Affairs. ""The challenge is to deliver the best service and an optimized fan experience and we have full confidence in HPE's teams to help us achieve our goals with their expertise.”

""We are very proud of the choice made by Olympique Lyonnais to modernize its technology environment and commit to the environment with HPE technologies,"" said Alain Melon, general manager of Hewlett Packard Enterprise in France. “Our HPE GreenLake platform provides Olympique Lyonnais with a scalable and flexible infrastructure capable of meeting the group's future technology needs to continue to deliver an exceptional experience to its fans and visitors.""

CHEOPS TECHNOLOGY, a long-time Platinum Partner of HPE and Olympique Lyonnais, brought its expertise and experience to enable a seamless installation of the infrastructure and continues its collaboration with future projects, such as the LDCL Arena, a 16,000-seat event venue owned by OL Groupe that will open in the last quarter of 2023.

“We are delighted to continue the adventure with Olympique Lyonnais alongside HPE,” said Claude Fournier, Regional Director of CHEOPS TECHNOLOGY. “In 2015, when we implemented the previous infrastructure, the qualities sought were mainly performance, resilience and security. During this renewal, we added a strong criterion on the environmental impact. The gains obtained are in line with the objectives of our service centers which continue to ensure the daily remote operation of this new architecture.”

Hewlett Packard Enterprise fortifies network security with acquisition of Security Service Edge provider Axis Security ,2023-03-02,"IN THIS ARTICLE

HPE intends to acquire Axis Security, a cloud security provider, expanding its edge-to-cloud security capabilities by offering a unified Secure Access Services Edge (SASE) solution to meet the increasing demand for integrated networking and security solutions delivered as-a-service
Axis Security’s Security Services Edge (SSE) platform addresses the need for improved application performance and increased network security as the number of remote users increases and as enterprises continue to migrate applications to the cloud
The HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform will integrate Axis Security’s cloud-native SSE platform, offering customers one single monthly subscription with no capital expenditure


HOUSTON, Texas – March 2, 2023 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Axis Security, a cloud security provider. This acquisition will allow HPE to expand its edge-to-cloud security capabilities by offering a unified Secure Access Services Edge (SASE) solution to meet the increasing demand for integrated networking and security solutions delivered as-a-service. Axis Security’s Security Services Edge (SSE) platform addresses the need for improved application performance and increased network security as the number of remote users increases and as enterprises continue to migrate applications to the cloud.

Axis Security’s SSE offerings enable access to corporate and public-cloud resources, and the company’s cloud-based platform will build on Aruba’s existing Software-defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) and network firewall offering. This combination will provide a complete edge-to-cloud SASE solution, ensuring that Zero Trust security controls can be applied to people and devices, no matter where they connect – on campus, branch, home, or on the road.

“As we transition from a post-pandemic world, and a hybrid work environment has become the new normal, a new approach is needed for network edge security to protect critical SaaS applications,” said Phil Mottram, executive vice president and general manager, HPE Aruba Networking. “The convergence of Aruba and Axis Security solutions will transform edge-to-cloud connectivity with a comprehensive SASE solution that provides enterprises with the highest levels of security for both IoT devices and all users’ access across geographically distributed locations. Today, we also accelerate our vision to help our customers expand their secure connectivity needs with SASE and private 5G solutions, building on our recently announced agreement to acquire private cellular technology provider, Athonet.”

Based in Tel Aviv, Israel, Axis Security provides a cloud-native SSE platform, Atmos, which delivers authenticated user access to private applications at the network edge, a secure web gateway (SWG) to safeguard user access to the Internet, and a cloud access security broker (CASB) that provides secure in-line access to SaaS apps, and Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) to provide insights into user experience. 

“We developed Axis Security to enable a world where connectivity to every business resource, from anywhere, could always be simple, safe and reliable,” said Dor Knafo, CEO of Axis Security. “Our SSE platform is a natural complement to Aruba’s SD-WAN, network firewall, and dynamic segmentation offerings. Together, we create a unified SASE platform, designed to extend connectivity to edge, and do so through a combination of modern access services – all working together in harmony.”

HPE enhances SASE offering with cloud security through integrated Axis Security platform

HPE will integrate Axis Security technology with its existing Aruba secure networking offerings to complete its SASE offering, which delivers WAN and cloud security controls directly to the application at the network edge, rather than routing data through the data center. This helps customers by flexibly delivering all of a provider’s networking components as a service with one point of control – instead of acquiring, maintaining, and licensing separate components individually.

In addition, the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform will integrate Axis Security’s cloud-native SSE platform, offering customers one single monthly subscription with no capital expenditure.  Customers can deploy these flexible as-a-service solutions with reduced risk and little upfront investment – and scale them according to demand.

HPE portfolio integration and availability

The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of the HPE 2023 fiscal year subject to customary closing conditions. HPE will integrate Axis Security’s solutions with its edge-to-cloud security solutions and plans to make them available to customers in the third quarter of the HPE 2023 fiscal year.

(a)     Represents the amortization of basis difference adjustments related to H3C. The three months ended January 31, 2023 includes the Company's portion of intangible asset impairment charges from H3C of $8 million.

(b)    Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company implemented certain organizational changes to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. This resulted in the transfer of certain storage networking products, previously reported within the Storage reportable segment, to the Compute reportable segment. The Company reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which primarily resulted in the transfer of net revenue and operating profit for each of the businesses as described above. These changes had no impact on the Company's previously reported consolidated results.

Use of non-GAAP financial measures

To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides financial measures including revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and free cash flow. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to revenue on a constant currency basis is revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) is operating profit (earnings from operations). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin is operating profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income tax rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow is cash flow from operations. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are included in the tables above or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release.

Use and economic substance of non-GAAP financial measures used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise

Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges relating to the amortization of initial direct costs, stock-based compensation expense and disaster charges (recovery). Non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), and non-GAAP operating profit margin are defined to exclude any charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, amortization of initial direct costs, impairment of goodwill, transformation costs, disaster charges (recovery), stock-based compensation expense and acquisition, disposition and other related charges (recovery). Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges, as well as an adjustment to earnings from equity interests, non-service net periodic benefit credit, tax indemnification and related adjustments, certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform and excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s historical and prospective financial performance, as well as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s performance relative to its competitors. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management also uses these non-GAAP measures to further its own understanding of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segment operating performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to better understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segments, as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. More specifically, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons:
 

Amortization of initial direct costs represents the portion of lease origination costs incurred in prior fiscal years that do not qualify for capitalization under the new leasing standard. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these costs as the Company elected the practical expedient under the new leasing standard. As a result, the Company did not adjust these historical costs to accumulated deficit. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that most financing companies did not elect this practical expedient and therefore the Company excludes these costs to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparisons to its peers.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions and any related impairment charges. Consequently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Hewlett Packard Enterprise recorded an impairment charge for the goodwill associated with its HPC & AI and Software reporting units following the annual goodwill impairment review. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods


Transformation costs represent net costs related to the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan and HPE Next initiative and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to transform Hewlett Packard Enterprise's IT infrastructure, net gains from the sale of real-estate and any impairment charges on real-estate identified as part of the initiative.  Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating such expenses and gains for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s past operating performance.


Disaster charges (recovery) are primarily related to the exit of the Company’s businesses in Russia and Belarus, and include credit losses of financing receivables and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned assets. Disaster charges (recovery) also include direct costs or recovery related to COVID-19 as a result of Hewlett Packard Enterprise-hosted, co-hosted, or sponsored event cancellations and shift to a virtual format. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating these amounts for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses, and such an exclusion facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs costs related to its acquisition, disposition and other related charges (recovery), most of which are treated as non-cash or non-capitalized expenses. The charges are direct expenses such as professional fees and retention costs. Charges may also include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal and arbitration settlements in connection with certain dispositions. Because non-cash or non-capitalized acquisition-related expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions and divestitures, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating such expenses for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s past operating performance.


Tax indemnification and related adjustments are primarily related to changes to certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise remains liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these income or charges and the associated tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Non-service net periodic benefit credit includes certain market-related factors such as (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains or losses, (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments and (vi) impacts from other market-related factors associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise's defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans. These market-driven retirement-related adjustments are primarily due to the change in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures and considers them to be outside the operational performance of the business.


Adjustment to earnings from equity interests includes the amortization of the basis difference in relation to the H3C divestiture and the resulting equity method investment in H3C. In the first fiscal quarter of 2023, this adjustment also included the Company's portion of intangible asset impairment charges from H3C. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating this amount for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise utilizes a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly related to the Company’s operating structure that can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, Hewlett Packard Enterprise evaluated a three-year financial projection. The projected rate assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year projection period and considers other factors including Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where Hewlett Packard Enterprise operates. For fiscal 2023, the Company will use a projected non-GAAP income tax rate of 14%, which reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP income tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. For fiscal 2022, the Company had a non-GAAP tax rate of 14%. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that making these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures, facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.


Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant & equipment (“PP&E”) less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. HPE’s management uses free cash flow for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in HPE’s businesses, repurchasing stock and other purposes. HPE’s management also uses free cash flow to evaluate HPE’s historical and prospective liquidity. Because free cash flow represents cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures (investments in PP&E less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, HPE believes that free cash flow provides a more accurate and complete assessment of HPE’s liquidity and capital resources.

 
Material limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are:
 

Amortization of initial direct costs and disaster charges (recovery) are excluded from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, which can have an impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure and HPE Financial Services segment results.


Items such as stock-based compensation expense that is excluded from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


Amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s cash position, represents the loss in value of intangible assets over time. The expense associated with this loss in value is excluded from non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


Items such as impairment of goodwill, transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges (recovery) that are excluded from non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures and cash flow.


Items such as adjustment to non-service net periodic benefit credit, tax indemnification and related charges and earnings from equity interests that are excluded from non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.


Items such as certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the related tax impacts from other non-GAAP measures that are excluded from the non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can also have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures.


Free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period.


Other companies may calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and free cash flow differently than Hewlett Packard Enterprise does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

 
Compensation for limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

Hewlett Packard Enterprise compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure within this news release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise encourages investors to review those reconciliations carefully.

Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors

Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that providing financial measures including revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and free cash flow to investors in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results “through the eyes” of management. Hewlett Packard Enterprise further believes that providing this information better enables Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s investors to understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance with the performance of other companies in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.

With the addition of OpsRamp’s services, new and existing HPE customers facing increasingly complex multi-vendor IT systems and workloads will be able to more efficiently manage IT investments and remediate incidents faster. Organizations benefit from one platform from which to automate, orchestrate, and operate their hybrid cloud estate.

 The OpsRamp capabilities extend the HPE services portfolio – across Advisory, Operational and HPE GreenLake managed services – into delivering end-to-end support for hybrid and multi-cloud IT environments. With this offering, customers can more effectively manage their heterogeneous cloud environments, dramatically reduce their operating expenses and enhance the overall IT experience for users. Capabilities include the consolidation of multi-vendor tools; automating and streamlining manual processes with AIOps; and significantly improving incident remediation with monitoring and observability.

 Headquartered in San Jose, California, OpsRamp was part of Hewlett Packard Pathfinder’s venture capital investment in 2020. OpsRamp delivers a hybrid digital operations management platform that supports thousands of customers worldwide to modernize and reduce the cost of their digital operations management. 

“The integration of OpsRamp’s hybrid digital operations management solution with the HPE GreenLake platform will provide an unmatched offering for organizations seeking to innovate and thrive in a complex, multi-cloud world. Partners and the channel will also play a pivotal role to advance their as-a-service offerings, as enterprises look for a unified approach to better manage their operations from the edge to the cloud,” said Varma Kunaparaju, CEO of OpsRamp. “We look forward to leveraging the scale and reach of HPE’s global go-to-market engine to deliver our unique offering and are excited for this journey ahead as part of HPE.”

 Today, HPE GreenLake supports more than 65,000 customers, powers more than two million connected devices and manages more than one exabyte of data with customers worldwide.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise deploys easy access and affordable healthcare services across pilgrimage sites in India,2023-04-25,"IN THIS ARTICLE

The Health ATM is an integrated one-stop touch screen kiosk designed to manage health-related information and allows individuals to access their personal health information at any time through any internet-connected web browser
It can screen more than 70 health parameters, including the patient’s height, weight, body temperature, blood glucose, blood pressure, invasive and non-invasive blood tests, heart check-up and oxygen saturation levels within fifteen minutes followed by an instant report




Bengaluru – April 25, 2023 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) today announced that it has deployed 50 Health ATMs across the Char Dham Yatra route in collaboration with the Department of Health and Family Welfare (DOHFW) in the state of Uttarakhand.

These cloud-enabled Health ATMs are installed at different points where pilgrims usually take a break while undertaking the pilgrimage to the four Himalayan shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. The main aim of these Health ATMs is to ease access to primary healthcare for the public in the remotest areas during their journey.

The Health ATM is a touch screen kiosk designed to manage health-related information and allows individuals to access their personal health information at any time through any internet-connected web browser.  It can screen more than 70 health parameters, including the patient’s height, weight, body temperature, blood glucose, blood pressure, invasive and non-invasive blood tests, heart check-up and oxygen saturation levels within fifteen minutes followed by an instant report. It can also assist patients by consulting with specialized and certified doctors and hospitals for the best treatment through its telemedicine consultation facility. These machines have a power back up of up to three hours. 

“The Health ATM technology is one of the most groundbreaking developments in the medical profession for providing accessible and affordable primary and preventive healthcare services,” said Shri Pushkar Singh Dhami, honorable Chief Minister of Uttarakhand. “We would like to thank HPE for their partnership to set up these Health kiosks along the Char Dham Yatra route. This is going to bridge the gap between urban and rural healthcare and improve the overall health of people in the remotest areas.”  

“India has one of the largest healthcare systems in the world but there are still challenges and gaps for access and availability of healthcare services in rural areas and underserved communities,” said Som Satsangi, SVP and managing director, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, India. “We are proud to partner with the government of Uttarakhand to install these Health ATMs to support the pilgrimage. At HPE, we believe in digital inclusion and will continue to drive initiatives to provide quality healthcare with the help of our innovative technology solutions to communities in the remotest areas.”

HPE Aruba Networking is announcing new products to help enterprise IT teams simplify operations with AIOps-driven cloud management, as well as new HPE GreenLake network-as-a-service capabilities
The next generation of HPE Aruba Networking Central has been re-designed to simplify network management operations and improve productivity by leveraging AI for IT operations
New NaaS capabilities are available for customers and channel partners to acquire, deploy, and manage on-demand networking on the HPE GreenLake platform with a monthly subscription
Both align with Aruba’s edge-to-cloud strategy, providing customers and partners with simpler ways to deliver and consume NaaS, as well as improving and simplifying management of IT operations via intelligent automation



LAS VEGAS – April 25, 2023 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today introduced product innovations to help enterprise IT teams simplify network management processes and improve operational agility with the next generation of HPE Aruba Networking Central, a cloud-native network management solution. HPE Aruba Networking also announced Network-as-a-service (NaaS) capabilities for customers and channel partners to acquire, deploy, and manage on the HPE GreenLake platform with a monthly subscription.

As IT teams remain understaffed and overtaxed, many enterprises lack the personnel required to manage multiple networking products and capabilities from multiple vendors. To alleviate time spent on network troubleshooting and optimization, the HPE Aruba Networking Central cloud network management platform has been re-designed to simplify operations and improve productivity by leveraging artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps) to reduce manual tasks, so stretched networking teams can focus on more strategic and higher-value projects.

HPE Aruba Networking is also introducing its Agile NaaS framework, designed to make on-demand networking easier for partners to sell and end-user customers to consume. New service pack capabilities added to HPE GreenLake for Aruba networking enable partners to bundle their design and delivery services for their customers with a monthly NaaS technology subscription.  

“A modernized network is the backbone for powering next-generation digital experiences and enabling new business models,” said Phil Mottram, executive vice president and general manager, HPE Aruba Networking. “The evolution of our AIOps in HPE Aruba Networking Central and Agile NaaS represents the next step toward more effectively managing operational complexity, while connecting with ever-expanding workloads from edge to cloud for a seamless hybrid work experience.” 

The next generation of HPE Aruba Networking Central delivers a wide range of business outcomes such as automated factory operations, customized customer experiences, a reduced carbon footprint, and omnichannel retail operations for a seamless shopping experience whether in-store, mobile, or online. Its new design leapfrogs legacy network management tools with new features that include:
 

Operator-centric design with a simplified user experience to enable more people across all skill levels, featuring entity-centric “solar system” views to promote intuitive navigation and reduce cognitive loads


The industry’s first “time-travel” feature for a contextually correlated ‘point-in-time’ view of the network that allows recovery in minutes to a specific point


Multi-layer physical and logical “sunburst” topology views to transform visualization of large, complex networks


Intelligent assurance indicators for device health and client experience, enabling rapid first-level triage


AI-powered full-stack insights for enhanced root cause analysis (RCA), impact assessment, and precise recommendationsDevice-agnostic Day 0 and Day 1 workflows with 100% API support to automate network configurations at scale

 
“To manage the modern network, tools need to sufficiently empower IT teams in a rapidly changing landscape, but unfortunately, too many network operations professionals feel their management tools aren’t reducing network problems to the degree they should,” said Maribel Lopez, founder and principal analyst, Lopez Research. “Companies need a new generation of management tools that are built for an AIOps environment, with unified workflows from Day 0 planning to Day 1 deployment and Day 2 troubleshooting and optimization, ultimately allowing the needs of the business to drive timelines for technology and the network – not the other way around.”

Agile NaaS is Aruba’s framework for helping customers successfully navigate and implement new consumption choices with network-as-a-service to deliver business outcomes faster:
  

Tools to enable networking teams to partner with the business to develop a NaaS strategy that meets their individual requirements


Support for a range of acquisition, deployment, and management models


The ability to incrementally introduce Network-as-a-Service without an entire network refresh


World class Zero Trust and SASE security, cloud performance and scale, and AI-powered automation so customers start with the best network foundation

 
New Service Pack enhancements on HPE GreenLake for Aruba networking include:
  

A new Network Policy NaaS service pack, based on Aruba’s award winning ClearPass network access control solution. This adds a new standardized NaaS network policy offering to complement eight previously introduced wired, wireless, and SD-Branch NaaS service packs from 2022.


HPE GreenLake for Aruba networking service packs are available for order by channel partners across 15 countries including Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. The new Network Policy service pack will be available for order starting in Q3 of HPE’s 2023 fiscal year.


“As organizations across the globe build a future connectivity strategy, they’re increasingly focusing on modern enterprise networks that are agile, responsive to business needs and simple to operate - while being powerful drivers of transformation,” said Brandon Butler, IDC Research Manager, Enterprise Networks. “HPE Aruba Networking has recognized that each organization has unique needs and is at the forefront of reinventing how customers and partners can consume or deliver more business-outcome focused networking. With the enhancements announced today, HPE Aruba Networking continues to advance its mature portfolio in the areas of AI, security, automation, and Network as a Service.”

“With network operations under pressure from a combination of the IT skills shortage, data complexity and fragmented network operations requirements, many enterprise customers are looking to automate more of their network management operations – and at the same time use AIOps to streamline delivery of network as a service,” said Joel Grace, senior vice president of client services, Sayers. “HPE GreenLake for Aruba networking service packs are exactly what our customers need to build and run an edge-to-cloud infrastructure in one place and pay for it all as a service.”

Integration of Axis Security and Athonet

HPE recently announced two acquisitions to expand the HPE Aruba Networking portfolio: Athonet for Private 5G connectivity and Axis Security for comprehensive SASE security solutions. The Axis Security acquisition closed in March, and its edge-to-cloud security solutions are now integrated with HPE Aruba Networking’s technology and will be on display at the innovation zone at Atmosphere.

"As digitalization demands increase, IT leaders miss vital connection between the enterprise network and employee experiences",2023-05-11,"IN THIS ARTICLE

Research features responses from 2,100 IT leaders across 21 countries and examines how IT leaders are currently approaching the enterprise network
There is a growing recognition from IT and business leaders of the breadth and scope of the network’s impact
Despite the continued demand for hybrid working, global IT leaders are failing to recognize the full extent of the connection between their enterprise network and employee experiences


SAN JOSE – May 11, 2023 – Despite the continued demand for hybrid working, global IT leaders are failing to recognize the full extent of the connection between their enterprise network and employee experiences. That's according to the latest research released by HPE Aruba Networking, which found that while three quarters of respondents believe digitization is fundamental both to employees being able to do their jobs and for talent attraction and retention, just 55% see the strong relevance of the network to these areas.

The research, which features responses from 2,100 IT leaders across 21 countries, examined how IT leaders are currently approaching the enterprise network, and assessed the extent to which they and the organization understand its role as a business-boosting asset and the impact they are seeing as a result.

The role of the network

On a positive note, there is a growing recognition from IT and business leaders of the breadth and scope of the network’s impact. According to 44% of IT leaders the network is primarily viewed by their business and its leadership as a tool for digital transformation, while a further 33% say their organization sees it playing a role in broader business transformation. In contrast, only 23% say their organization recognizes the network merely for its functional connectivity.

However, the results also pointed to missed connections in where this transformation might come from – particularly with regards to delivering employee experiences.

Connecting employee experiences with the network

Three quarters of IT leaders believe digitization is fundamental both for talent attraction and to employees being able to do their jobs. However, with recognition of the network’s relevance to employee attraction and retention the lowest of all the business areas listed, it is perhaps unsurprising that this was also the area where IT leaders estimate that the network is currently having the least impact. Or the least positive impact.

This impact becomes apparent when considering what today’s networks seem capable of delivering – only 43% of IT leaders say their network enables staff to work from anywhere, and just 34% agree that their network can deliver seamless connectivity. Meanwhile, with digital personalization in mind, even fewer (29%) note that their network enables them to offer employees a Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) service.

“Given the prevalence and demand for flexible working, the lack of understanding around how the network can enhance employee experiences seems a particularly dangerous miss,” said Sylvia Hooks, CMO, HPE Aruba Networking. “The simple fact is that no one can do their job nowadays without the network. But, while organizations are recognizing the network as a business-critical resource in enhancing their digital transformation journey, in today’s working environment this requirement goes way beyond offering connectivity – a more seamless, efficient, intelligent and securely connected experience is essential.” 

Where is the network currently delivering return on investment?

The top three strongest connections IT leaders made between the network and various parts of the business were IT efficiency, operational efficiency, and cybersecurity (core elements of most digital transformation projects).

These were also the areas where respondents are seeing the biggest impact of the network, and, perhaps more crucially, where those who’ve invested in the network within the last two years are seeing the greatest business outcomes. Comparatively, those who haven’t been able to invest in the network reported 21 percentage points less positive impact on average across all business areas.

While investment is critical for deepening the network’s returns, it is clear that there is still untapped potential for the network to deliver across additional business-boosting areas. To unlock the network’s true potential budget should be channeled into the right infrastructure – one that modernizes all aspects of network operations.

“A modern network can not only strengthen employee experiences and attract the right talent pool but it also has the potential to deliver impact across all areas of the business,” concluded Larry Lunetta, vice president portfolio solutions marketing, HPE Aruba Networking. “However, to realize this broader transformation, IT leaders need to reframe network discussions and start talking in terms of business outcomes versus technical specs. Only by doing this can they show the C-suite that investment correlates to positive impact and drives business value.”

Crown Commercial Service signs new Memorandum of Understanding with Hewlett Packard Enterprise to accelerate the adoption of sustainable IT in the public sector,2023-05-18,"IN THIS ARTICLE

CCS customers can benefit from HPE’s environmental and sustainability services, including a sustainability assessment that will help them create a sustainability strategy
The new MoU adds key systems like composable, software-defined infrastructure for hybrid cloud environments, high performance compute for AI applications and highly resilient storage solutions for mission-critical applications


London, UK – May 18, 2023 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today announced that it has signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Crown Commercial Service (CCS) to provide UK public sector organizations with HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud solutions that support the UK government’s net zero commitment. In addition to HPE’s full range of compute, storage, networking and cloud solutions, public sector organizations will have access to value-added sustainability services at no additional cost.

 CCS – the UK’s largest public procurement organization – supports the public sector to achieve maximum commercial value when procuring common goods and services. In 2021/22, CCS helped the public sector to achieve commercial benefits equal to £2.8 billion – supporting world-class public services that offer the best value for taxpayers. With the new MoU with HPE, CCS can support public sector organizations on their cloud journey with the latest hybrid cloud solutions, whilst driving more cost and energy efficiency. Furthermore, for the first time the agreement also includes services, expanding the scope and the practical use of the MoU across the wider public sector.

“CCS has renewed and extended our relationship with HPE through this updated Memorandum of Understanding which will help our customers accelerate their IT modernization, achieve sustainability and utilize systems that harness the power of data to improve services for citizens,” said Philip Orumwense CBE, Commercial Director and Chief Technology Procurement Officer at Crown Commercial Service (CCS). “This MoU extends to cover all areas of HPE's portfolio including new key areas such as HPE's pay-as-you go GreenLake platform - making it easier for all public sector bodies, no matter how big or small, to get value for money.”

Since the introduction of the Cloud First Policy in 2013, the UK public sector organizations are facing the challenge of advancing on their cloud journey while having critical services still running on legacy technology.

The HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform will enable them to flexibly scale and actively manage infrastructure utilization at a granular level, eliminating overprovisioning and optimizing energy consumption.

Additionally, as part of the new MoU with HPE, CCS customers can benefit from HPE’s environmental and sustainability services, including a free sustainability assessment for the first 100 customers to help them create a sustainability strategy. The assessment provides an analysis of energy efficiency, providing guidance on IT transformation considerations, data center optimization, as well as engineering and transformation project services to drive sustainability. Additionally, public sector organization will have access to annual reports detailing factors like sustainability savings, IT asset up- and recycling, and the value of resold upcycled assets. These will help to quantify the environmental impact and savings achieved through IT asset lifecycle solutions and can be leveraged by the organizations for their sustainability reporting.  

“With the revisions to the government’s 2050 net-zero emissions strategy the pressure on the UK public sector is increasing to deploy sustainable solutions while balancing their IT needs and cost between legacy technology and the government’s cloud strategy,” said Andrew Young, vice president of UK & Ireland Sales, HPE. “At HPE we are delighted that with the new MoU we can support public sector organizations on their journey to the cloud with highly efficient solutions designed with sustainability in mind and an edge-to-cloud platform that allows them to closely monitor their consumption. HPE GreenLake can help organizations that are struggling to modernize their systems or with public cloud pricing, providing an alternative, cost-efficient solution that allows them to optimally manage their workloads and data.”

 With the new MoU, CCS and HPE are expanding the portfolio of compute products available, adding key systems like the composable, software-defined infrastructure for hybrid cloud environments and high performance compute (HPC) for artificial intelligence applications. It now also includes crucial storage capabilities, ranging from the full breadth of intelligent HPE Alletra Storage systems, covering everything from general purpose to business-critical workloads, to highly resilient storage solutions for mission-critical applications.

 Through the latest application, analytics, and developer services recently added to the HPE GreenLake portfolio, CCS customers will be able to modernize their workloads and data across their hybrid cloud infrastructure. With HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise, for example, a new offering providing an automated, flexible, scalable, and fully managed enterprise-grade private cloud, they will have access to an out-of-the-box modern cloud experience with optimized performance, open choice and low and predictable TCO.

Fully curated, enterprise-supported solution for open-source analytics tools improves productivity 
New SaaS approach provides predictable, transparent economics and precise controls to optimize cost and utilization across environments


HOUSTON, Texas – May 16, 2023 – Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) today introduced the next step in the HPE Ezmeral Software platform, designed to help organizations leverage data globally and deploy analytics at scale through a predictable, software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution for hybrid multi-cloud environments. HPE Ezmeral Software extends the edge-to-cloud data and analytics capabilities of HPE GreenLake and provides the data and analytics foundation for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) projects. The simplified platform now features an all-new user interface, expanded selection of the most popular data sources and open-source tools, interoperability across the platform and its tools, and a consistent cloud operating experience.

Despite growing demand to create new revenue streams and efficiencies from data, only 24 percent of enterprise data created in 2022 was leveraged for analytics or fed into AI/ML workloads1. This is due to several challenges that organizations of all types and sizes face today. First, data is more siloed across multiple clouds and different data formats and sources. Second, enterprises grapple with analytics tools and workloads that struggle to meet performance, cost and compliance requirements. Finally, public cloud-based solutions bring limited data controls, unpredictable costs and risk of vendor and data lock-in, while do-it-yourself, open-source tools are not built for enterprise IT and security requirements.

HPE Ezmeral Software provides a complete data and analytics platform with predictable and transparent economics, enabling organizations to confidently innovate with data everywhere. The enhanced HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric Software provides the foundation with a single, federated view of data across hybrid and multi-cloud deployments, so organizations can easily access, analyze, and govern data globally. The new HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software builds on this foundation and empowers developers and data analytics professionals with self-service access to fully managed and curated open-source tools for the complete lifecycle of analytics and AI/ML workloads. Together, the data fabric and analytics solutions from HPE enable organizations to harness data across their enterprise for analytics and AI/ML projects that improve decision-making and unlock new revenue streams.
 

HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric Software provides seamless access across multiple data sources and formats, including files, objects, tables and streams, as well as across hybrid cloud deployments. The software is available for the first time as a SaaS offering and with a new intuitive user interface.

Welcome to Next,2023-04-25,"HPE Aruba Networking introduces Agile NaaS, a flexible new consumption and management framework
Networking, like all technology, is fascinating because it never stands still. The pace of technology change may ebb and flow, but we are in a particularly vibrant phase based on the way technology is now an essential partner in achieving organization goals and business outcomes.

Much of this comes from broad changes in the IT environment, such as the adoption of hybrid cloud deployments and the push to leverage data and compute from the edge to the cloud to deliver the insights that drive innovation. Add in tight budgets, scarce resources, and the need for more predictable IT expenditures, it’s clear the top priority is to automate operations while providing organizations flexible as a Service acquisition and management options. Given that the network is the central nervous system for this transformation, the need for new thinking about the role of networking, how it is architected, and the services it delivers is clear.

Looking back over the last ten years, we started this journey by first focusing on moving network management from on-premises to the cloud. In fact, we introduced Aruba Central in 2014 to do just that.  Then came the “AI generation,” where our huge customer base and the data it generates provided the opportunity to build machine learning-based AI models that are proven to reduce the load on stretched networking teams by cutting the time and effort required for tasks such as troubleshooting and optimization. Now, HPE Aruba Networking Central, which runs on the HPE GreenLake cloud platform, builds on the experience of managing hundreds of millions of end point devices, combined with mature, proven AI to deliver better security, automation, and Network as a Service (NaaS). To introduce this new era, we are making two major announcements at Atmosphere 2023: next generation Central and Agile Network as a Service.  This is in addition to two recent acquisitions that we have made: Athonet for Private 5G connectivity and Axis Security for comprehensive SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) and SSE (Secure Service Edge) security solutions.

While those acquisitions provide our customers and partners expanding connectivity and security choices for the next generation of networking, today I’m excited to introduce the foundation for what’s next.  The next generation of Central has been designed to drive business innovation with:
 

AI-powered automation to meet the growing demand for more efficient operations

NaaS to move more quickly and reduce the stress on resources

Rapid introduction of new services, such as 5G, to expand the connectivity footprint

A built-in Zero Trust framework to deliver security solutions such NAC (Network Access Control), SASE, and SSE for better protection.
 
This next generation of Central leverages our market-leading AI to infuse every part of the network management workflow with the intelligence and automation required to keep up with the needs of business. For us, AI is not an add-on, not demoware, but foundational for network success from planning device installation locations on Day 0 to zero touch deployment on Day 1 and then automated SLA monitoring and optimization for Day 2 onward. And to amplify the value of AI-powered operations, the new Central user interface and workflow are tuned specifically to deliver the data and insights network teams need to delight end users and deliver on business requirements. Given this mission, Central and the underlying AI-powered automation are essential to success, especially as organizations consider new models for acquiring, deploying, and managing their networks. That’s why we are so excited about introducing Agile NaaS, our framework for helping customers navigate and implement new consumption and management choices with NaaS to deliver faster business outcomes.

There is a lot of confusion around what NaaS is and how it should be implemented and paid for, with many people pushing “one size fits all.” While monthly subscriptions and flex up/down capacity adjustment are key NaaS attributes, there are many other variables to consider, such as how and by whom the network is managed, how NaaS is introduced and deployed, etc. Agile NaaS helps organizations start with their desired business outcomes and then develop an acquisition and consumption approach that fits their needs. The power of Agile NaaS is that we can combine existing network and deployment approaches with the flexibility to introduce HPE GreenLake for Aruba NaaS at your own pace—project by project or all at once.  With Agile NaaS, we are committed to giving you choices on how to best purchase and operate our solutions.

With its AI-powered automation and operations interface, this new generation of Central was designed for what is next, including NaaS. And we’ve used our customer NaaS experiences from global enterprises to small businesses to guide its design. That is why we are introducing Agile NaaS together with the next generation of Central. No matter how customers choose to modernize their networks, they can gain the benefit of these innovations while making sure that when they embark on their NaaS implementation, it will be a success.

Add Private 5G and SASE security to this mix and the next generation is off to a roaring start.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/04/welcome-to-next.html,"IN THIS ARTICLE

10 insights on leading through change,2023-03-29,"Gerri Gold shares insights from fellow HPE leaders for our customers, partners and beyond, navigating through their transformation
Since HPE declared our vision to be the edge-to-cloud company, we’ve made significant progress in our transformation.  From our strategy to operating model, culture, and brand – we’ve been architects, resetting the way. Recently, I had the great pleasure of hosting a panel with fellow HPE leaders; to share experiences, and converse on how we take our collective skills and talent, break down silos and accelerate our journey.

The advice of my peers resonated with me so much, that I wanted to share those insight with leaders across our customers, partners and beyond, as they navigate their own digital transformation and change management. Here are my picks, some of the standouts from the panel:

1.    Show up every day and be relentless.
As a leader, you need to be relentless in driving alignment, accountability, advocacy, and advancing talent and culture. Sure, it can be exhausting, and some days are tougher than others. But we are a people business: The energy and confidence you bring will have a huge impact.

2.    Build strong relationships and have the tough conversations.
It’s impossible to be aligned without healthy strong relationships, and it starts from a place of trust. We have to constantly be asking for feedback and giving feedback. Be intentional about your relationship goals.

3.    Give yourself time to think about transformation.
Take the time to develop yourself, to learn, think, reflect and on what is working and not working. Tough one, right? But if it’s important, and it certainly is, calendar it! Be disciplined about making time to strategize and brainstorm with your peers.

4.    Try radical transparency.
Share your journey and tell the truth. As a leader, you feel like you have to be strong, but those moments of vulnerability can add huge credibility.

5.    Listen before charging in.
That’s the famous “two ears and one mouth, use in that proportion”! Listen first. Really understand the culture and how people like to get things done, so you can adapt your approach and be more effective moving forward.

6.    Position tough work as a mission, not a burden.
This is one that particularly resonates with me. People hold tough work as a burden or a mission. Taking on a mission translates to people feeling like they are making a difference. Rallying around a goal, with a team effort in place, can sustain that “mission” mentality going forward. The sense of mission can create an amazing forward-moving energy

7.    Recognize that some thrive in change, and some don’t. Lead accordingly so everyone contributes.
In any given team, some thrive in change, others need more time and dialogue before they embrace it. As a leader, you need to mobilize the positive energy, bring clarity to drive change forward, but also address ambiguity or resistance. In fact, some may become your strongest allies in the longer run, once they’ve come out of the change curve.

8.    Know what makes team members tick and tailor motivation.
Get to know what makes your team members “tick” - that motivation will guide how you approach each person differently.

9.    Have the agency to break down silos.
Be willing to have those “difficult” conversations to break down silos and align to the priorities of your customer needs. Engage representation from all relevant facets to show the value they bring, but always keep your strategic direction and your customer needs as primary compasses.

10.    Always be on the hunt for talent.
There’s a lot of hidden talent in an organization. As leaders, we have a responsibility to spot the talent in those that are ambitious about the work, but maybe not as ambitious about advancing themselves. As one of my peers on the panel said: Our job is to look for the folks that don’t raise their hand.  

So many great insights from my peers. I look forward to implementing, or reviving, some of the tactics in my own day-to-day leadership.

When our panel closed, someone stood up in the audience. It was our HPE Chief Financial Officer Tarek Robbiati. He shared his feedback with us, and how he appreciated the felt empathy, and the importance placed on truth. Two things he said will stay with me for a while I know:  “The truth is the foundation of any high performance company,” and “Uncertainty is opportunity. Because there is no comfort in growth and no growth in comfort.” So true!

The reality is, in this complex world we’re in - even more so than in the past - leaders are learning along with their teams – and learning from each other.

Foster a culture of trust: Trust is the foundation of any strong relationship. Leaders should create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas, and where they can rely on each other for support and guidance.\r\n\r\n3. Encourage feedback: Feedback is essential for growth and improvement. Leaders should encourage their team members to provide constructive feedback and be open to receiving feedback themselves.\r\n\r\n4. Be accountable: Leaders should take responsibility for their actions and decisions, and hold themselves and their team members accountable for meeting goals and expectations.\r\n\r\n5. Be adaptable:"", ' One way leaders can give themselves time to think about transformation and develop themselves to be more effective leaders is by prioritizing self-reflection and continuous learning. This can involve setting aside dedicated time for personal and professional development, seeking feedback from others, and actively seeking out opportunities to learn and grow. Additionally, leaders can also prioritize building a strong support network of mentors, coaches, and peers who can provide guidance and support as they navigate their own transformation journey.']"

HPE opens Cyber Defense Center in Houston,2023-10-12,"Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility between HPE and our customers, partners, and team members, as a single weak link can impact all
Cyber criminals are smarter than ever and use increasingly advanced tactics. To combat attacks, we must be prepared to recognize, prevent and remove threats 24/7/365.

This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we sat down with Bobby Ford, HPE’s Chief Security Officer, to learn about HPE’s newly opened, state-of-the-art Cyber Defense Center at its Houston headquarters, and discuss how the company thinks about cybersecurity.

Q: What does the Cyber Defense Center do?

A: The Cyber Defense Center serves as our global cybersecurity operations headquarters and houses our incident response analysts. 3.5 billion events happen per day at HPE.The team analyzes data using AI, with the most complex cases handled by the team in this room. 

The center also serves as a training ground for new cybersecurity talent to learn and develop their skills alongside experienced analysts and leaders. It’s situated adjacent to our Customer Innovation Center, providing an immersive experience for customers interested in learning how HPE practices cybersecurity. Q: Where else does HPE have cybersecurity operations?

A: The Houston hub is supported by our Cyber Defense Center in Galway, Ireland, and we’re building out a third center in Bangalore India, forming a 24 hour/ “follow the sun” cybersecurity monitoring and response operation.

Q: How was the space designed?

A: We wanted to design a central command center for our new HQ that would serve as a hub for our incident response coordination. The center’s open-concept workspace promotes collaboration, while the adjacent briefing room provides a more intimate space for small group conversations. Interactive touchscreens and enhanced audio-visual capabilities enable our teams to collaborate effectively and share information seamlessly. A lot of highly confidential information is shared in this room, so privacy is of utmost concern. The glass wall between the main area and the briefing room goes from clear to opaque with the flip of a switch when needed. And perhaps coolest of all, the room’s lighting changes during events, with red indicating a highest severity incident, alerting team members and visitors when something serious is happening.

Q: What kind of training do cybersecurity professionals receive?

A: As any CSO or CISO knows, cybersecurity talent is precious, so we do our best to give our team members ample opportunity to develop their skills and grow their careers. We do that in a variety of ways, from funding advanced degrees and certification boot camps to offering hands-on learning through our “gig” program, where team members sign up for short-term projects and gain new experience. In addition, we’ve put a lot of effort into growing talent from the ground up. Our internship and early career programs have proven incredibly successful for years, and our newer Cybersecurity Career Reboot program, now a year old, has enabled us to recruit and develop new talent from often overlooked candidate pools – people with no college degree or cybersecurity experience whatsoever. The Cyber Defense Center will serve as a critical training ground, where entry-level team members can sit side-by-side with experienced analysts and learn by doing.   Q: Is the HPE cybersecurity organization engaged in any volunteerism or community involvement initiatives?

A: Cybercrime affects all of us, and our team members are passionate about using their skills as a force for good. For example, our team recently became involved in volunteering for the CyberPeace Institute, an international organization that aids humanitarian NGOs in preparing for and recovering from cyberattacks. In addition, our Women in Security group provides security awareness education for youth groups and charitable organizations. Their work has helped survivors of technology-facilitated domestic abuse, and more recently is being leveraged to teach survivors of modern slavery and human trafficking how to securely set up their devices and online accounts so they aren’t victimized again. On an individual basis, many of our team members volunteer in their local communities, schools, and churches to teach their neighbors how to be cyber safe.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/10/hpe-opens-cyber-defense-center-in-houston.html,"IN THIS ARTICLE

HPE launches three climate tech impact accelerators,2023-09-18,"Program aims to leave no innovation unsupported in the fight against climate change
Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time, in no small part due to how interconnected we are as a society. Our individual actions – or lack of action – accumulate and multiply in impact. The ability to change the destructive trajectory we are on, in which 5 million excess deaths are anticipated between 2030 and 2050, requires a collective effort. Technology has the potential to play a major role in decarbonization, but the lack of investment in climate technology startups, particularly those led by diverse founders, is leaving innovation on the table. In the spirit of partnership, inclusion, and innovation that is part of HPE’s DNA, we are launching three new Climate Technology Impact Accelerators with the goal of helping foster the next wave of innovation to combat climate change and with support from partners in finance, industry, and government.

Each accelerator has its own specific focus on supporting various aspects of the climate tech ecosystem, and all are focused on startups with leaders from diverse communities:

Sustainability Subscribed: HPE has partnered with Village Capital, an organization that supports impact-focused early-stage startups, and Zuora, a software company that supports businesses with recurring revenue models, to provide financial support and mentorship to entrepreneurs developing sustainability and climate solutions deployed as-a-service that are focused on underserved communities. Sustainability Subscribed is geared toward readying founders to attract capital by increasing the investment readiness of their solutions and business models.

National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Channel Partner Award: NREL and Wells Fargo are working with HPE and a number of electric utilities from around the country to increase the capacity of two Ecosystem Support Organizations which, in turn, will eliminate traditional obstacles that are frequently confronted by founders from underrepresented communities, such as underinvestment, high rates of failure, and lack of access to financial and social capital. Climate tech often lacks corporate and investor engagement as it is deemed too risky. This accelerator will help ensure equal opportunities and de-risk the climate tech innovation ecosystem.

LabStart: Drawing on HPE’s longstanding work with the U.S. Department of Energy, LabStart will extend access to the Department’s state-of-the-art national labs to diverse entrepreneurs to accelerate the development of their climate tech innovations into market-ready solutions. This program will help develop a larger pipeline of talented, diverse entrepreneurs, including those from non-traditional backgrounds. LabStart also aims to reduce friction to commercializing lab technology by helping entrepreneurs overcome structural, policy, and financial barriers. In designing the Climate Tech Impact Accelerator program, HPE is drawing on its long history as a company dedicated to innovation. We know that innovation requires not just support for individual initiatives, but support for a thriving ecosystem of entrepreneurs united in common purpose. And, as our CEO, Antonio Neri, often says, diversity drives innovation. The ecosystem – for climate technology or any other – benefits from the diverse perspectives that can only come when everyone around you doesn’t look and think the same. By lending HPE’s expertise, technology, and partnerships to communities that are too often underserved by venture capital and philanthropy, the Climate Tech Impact Accelerator program is working to ensure that less innovation goes wasted, overlooked, or undeveloped.

How do we realistically achieve sustainability in telecoms?,2023-04-13,"Jeff Edlund, chief technology officer of HPE's Communications Technology Group, explains where we are in our sustainability goals, and what’s next in the industry.
Achieving significant reductions in energy usage and carbon emissions in the telecoms sector takes an attitude change, but more importantly, it’ll take industry cooperation to become a reality. But making climate change goals also requires a technology shift that will drive traffic growth and threaten to push up energy usage.


Where do we see the telecom sector being able to make traction towards sustainability goals?  

The good news for operators is that the investments they make now in equipment and services designed to help them reach their goals will have a much broader, long-standing impact on their businesses.

Most global telecoms operators have detailed plans to reduce emissions in the coming years. Scope 1 and 2 emissions are direct and indirect emissions respectively, generated by fuel usage or the electricity companies purchase to run their networks. Scope 3 accounts for 80% of telecoms emissions and refers to the entire value chain – from equipment produced by the telcos’ suppliers to emissions generated by products and services supplied to end-users.

Naturally, reducing Scope 3 emissions needs cooperation and technology executives are increasingly looking to us to utilize our expertise.
 

How does reducing emissions migrate from an attitude change to a long-lasting impact change?

Currently, HPE is working with Intel to help service provider customers with their 5G rollouts, and a key part of that is helping them to meet their sustainability goals.  Imperatively, taking a data-first approach to the network. This involves putting intelligence at the network edges and only transporting data and communications back to the core when necessary.

Modern software building technologies are also a must. Software needs to be built from the ground up for cloud native services that are deployed as microservices, which are only used when they are needed. There is also a need for efficient programming languages to reduce the burden on the infrastructure, enabling it to consume less energy, and continued innovation in compute infrastructure for power reductions.

 

HPE is one of several companies in the vendor community to be aiming to achieve net zero across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2040. How is that happening?

In 2022, HPE required all staff at VP level and above to undertake climate training and, starting in 2023, its executive committee members will have part of their bonus calculation based on them setting low-carbon roadmaps for the parts of the business that they run.

Ultimately for HPE, helping telcos to reduce their carbon footprint will also bring our own down; 65% of our footprint comes from customers using our products.

 

Going back to the industry cooperation needed to make any headway, why is this the differentiator?

This kind of change requires partnership across the entire ecosystem. This isn't just about cost and ploughing more dollars into investment in the network just to get to business as usual. This is about using our dollars efficiently to optimise the things that we do today and for the future – and we’ll find that the investment pays back far more than was ever put into it.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/04/how-do-we-realistically-achieve-sustainability-in-telecoms.html,,"['What are the main challenges that the telecoms sector faces in achieving sustainability goals?', 'How can operators balance their sustainability goals with the need for traffic growth?', 'What role do you think technology can play in reducing emissions in the telecoms sector?']","["" The main challenges that the telecoms sector faces in achieving sustainability goals are:\n\n1.

How engaged team members create a company’s culture,2023-04-17,"HPE is creating spaces for team members to thrive, in life and work
One year ago this month, HPE officially opened the doors to its new Houston headquarters. It was always our vision to create a next-generation collaboration and culture center that meets the evolving expectations of our teams, especially in this new world of work flexibility. And, although biased, I can say I think we have accomplished that.

We centered our headquarters around fostering teamwork and social interaction, and being able to accommodate team members' changing needs. It’s important to note that even though we headquarter in the Lone Star state, we have more than 200 sites across 60 countries that offer a supportive and collaborative environment, with the flexibility to make work fit their life instead of the other way around, improving productivity and customer outcomes. Most of our sites are designed to provide spaces in which team members can have fun and brainstorm in non-traditional settings.

In Houston, team members can literally build relationships via an onsite Makerspace or learn about honeybee conservation via our rooftop bee apiary that we partner on with Hives for Heroes, which helps foster a healthy transition from military service.

This month, we also hold our annual Team Member Appreciation Day, worldwide. An event like this takes the hard work of site leadership and team members that volunteer their own personal time to make these events memorable. More than 130 of our sites are hosting activities for team members and those who aren’t on site are invited to attend virtual activities.  It will be the first time in three years where we have dedicated site events for our team members to celebrate together in-person. Team Member Appreciation Day is our way of showing appreciation for everything our team members do in support of HPE’s success – and we’re following the day with a full-day wellness Friday, where everyone has an entire day off.

Our hope is to continue to lead the market in technology, and lead in creating a culture that other companies will want to emulate. In my opinion, both go hand-in-hand – it’s almost compulsory to have fun with the people you work with to excel as a company. So much so, that HPE again made the 2023 Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list.

Whether in Houston or around the globe, our team members are our greatest asset, and we strive to keep them motivated and feeling appreciated yearlong.

HPE completes acquisition of private 5G leader Athonet,2023-06-16,"Addition bolsters HPE’s position in wireless connectivity, enabling telcos to unlock new revenue streams and helping enterprises accelerate private cellular deployments
I am thrilled to announce that as of June 15, HPE has completed its acquisition of Athonet, a leading private cellular networking specialist. This acquisition signifies a major leap forward for HPE in our mission to revolutionize the private networking market, in part through simplifying and accelerating the deployment of private 5G.

I fundamentally believe that the true value of 5G lies with enterprises rather than consumers. The billions of dollars spent on acquiring spectrum and deploying 5G networks will not be covered by consumer customers, instead the opportunity lies with enterprise use cases. Private 5G is by far the most exciting enterprise use case for 5G, offering high levels of coverage, reliability and mobility that augments the cost-effective, high-capacity connectivity provided by Wi-Fi. In our view, bringing private 5G and Wi-Fi together is the future of enterprise connectivity. With its robust track record of more than 450 deployments across diverse sectors including healthcare, transport and logistics, utilities, and government, Athonet strengthens our leadership in the blossoming private cellular market. Athonet’s robust and innovative solutions have earned the company high regard and trust among enterprises, analysts, vendors and telcos alike. In the months since we announced our intention to acquire Athonet, HPE customers have expressed a great deal of excitement over the prospect of adopting Athonet’s award-winning technology.

Now adding Athonet, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company, to our offering immediately primes us for a key position in the fast-growing private cellular market. According to IDC, the private cellular market is expected to be worth over $1.6 billion by 2026 for core networking alone1.

With the integration of Athonet, we will offer a holistic, straightforward approach to deploying the connected edge, helping telcos service this growing market and giving enterprises the confidence to leverage this technology. Our comprehensive private 5G, managed Wi-Fi, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), and edge compute portfolios positions us perfectly to empower both telcos and enterprises on their private networking journeys.

My team is ready to hit the ground running taking our new expanded offering to a global market. HPE’s international sales team and global partner network can accelerate Athonet’s private network deployments on a huge scale. For many years, Athonet has been recognized for its industry-leading technology, and now with the global might of HPE behind it, I am excited at the growth opportunities in front of us.

An immediate opportunity I see is with our telco customer base. One of the paramount challenges telcos have faced over the years is generating new revenue from their networks. The monetization of network infrastructure has become increasingly complex as hyperscalers continue to extend their footprint into the telecom space. Telcos need to find ways to create value beyond basic data delivery and unlock new revenue-generating services.

The emergence of private 5G networks presents a remarkable opportunity for telcos, with enterprise customers demanding customized 5G experiences that offer low latency, increased reliability and extended range. I passionately believe that HPE is the partner that telcos need to take advantage of this growing market.

HPE is setting the stage for tremendous growth and innovation in the private networking portfolio by integrating Athonet’s expertise into our existing telco and HPE Aruba Networking enterprise offerings, and leveraging HPE’s global sales and partner ecosystem. This acquisition is a powerful statement of our commitment to extending our leadership in edge-to-cloud solutions.

We're delighted to welcome Athonet to the HPE family, and look forward to driving digital transformation for our customers from edge-to-cloud.

The superpowers of AI come with great responsibility,2023-07-10,"At HPE, we believe AI must be sustainable, responsible, and enable data privacy
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is clearly becoming an integral component of our future, including its ability to turn questions into discovery, insights into action, and our unlimited imagination into reality. AI will create superpowers for those who tap into it, fueling tremendous advancements for business and unlocking the solutions to some of the most pressing societal challenges we face, including climate change, the energy transition, and disease.

But with these great superpowers comes great responsibility. In the race to apply AI, organizations run the risk of relinquishing control of their data and privacy, potentially compromising their long-term competitive advantage. Given the amount of energy required to power AI, those same enterprises may also increase their carbon footprint. And without an intentional strategy around the responsible use of AI, businesses may not apply AI ethically or in line with their values.

So, how can businesses and society reap AI’s benefits while avoiding the repercussions that may come with it?

AI Can Unlock Innovation to Solve Societal Challenges

AI will increase the velocity of innovation across every industry. It has already begun to usher in a new scale of productivity and enable us to break new boundaries, and its abilities are nearly limitless.

For example, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, scientists immediately turned to supercomputers to accelerate research using AI to better understand and combat the new virus. The scientists created a detailed 3D model of the spike protein to understand the strain and test it for potential drug interactions. Leveraging AI, the team accelerated calculations from 24 hours to just eight minutes, allowing them to run 1.2 million experiments per day.  This saved thousands of hours, millions of dollars and countless lives.

AI can also be used to assist a wind farm designer to optimize their models to harness more power for homes and buildings. It can transform the role of first responders by enabling them to predict and mitigate the impact of catastrophic weather events through sophisticated digital twin modeling. It can even revolutionize weather modeling on climate change, accelerate the quest for nuclear fusion, and more.

However, business and government leaders must work together to reap the benefits of these innovations without compromising data privacy, sustainability, or responsibility. Data Privacy Becomes Even More Critical

Data is the new currency that powers the digital economy. The key to success is extracting value from it. AI is an ideal tool to accomplish this, but organizations must pursue AI in a way that leverages their data privately to avoid diminishing its value. Customers should choose an AI cloud provider that does not use customer data to train its own models or use the data as a product to be resold or utilized with other offerings.

Through HPE’s AI cloud, HPE GreenLake for Large Language Models, we enable users privately train, tune and deploy their own models, utilize pre-trained models of partners, or establish domain-specific LLM capabilities using their own data without trepidation about leaking intellectual property or other sensitive data. 

Managing the Environmental Impact of AI

As companies pursue net-zero targets, CIOs face increasing pressure to meet sustainability goals that consider and address the increasing desire to use power-hungry AI systems. From training to tuning to inference, the amount of energy required to use AI is enormous and will continue to grow.

As an example, researchers from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, recently investigated the model training process for natural-language processing and learned the process could emit more than 626,000 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent. That’s equal to nearly five times the lifetime emissions of an average American car.

The rapid uptake of AI requires us to be more intentional about sustainable IT innovation. While AI holds the promise of helping solve climate change, we must avoid it contributing to that problem. We must address energy consumption at every level – and organizations must embed it into their AI strategies from the start.

That means using more sustainable data center and colocation designs that leverage renewable energy sources, such as green hydrogen or solar power and wind power – as well as liquid cooling of the computing systems.  The warm water created by the liquid cooling waste can be used for growing produce in greenhouses or heating homes – which can make the footprint carbon negative.

It also means more efficient AI and infrastructure innovation to optimize the use of resources – the faster the supercomputer, the more efficient use of time and energy is deployed to run AI models. HPE has great experience in this space; HPE Cray supercomputers represent 6 of the top 10 supercomputers on the GREEN500 list, which ranks the 500 most energy efficient supercomputers in the world. A Commitment to Using AI Responsibly

While AI has the potential to solve some of society’s biggest, most pressing challenges, we must harness and govern the power of AI in an ethical and responsible manner. HPE believes AI must be:

 

Privacy-enabled and secure – respect individual privacy, be secure, and minimize the risk of errors and unintended, malicious use. 

Human-focused – respect human rights and be designed with mechanisms and safeguards, such as human oversight to prevent misuse.

Inclusive – minimize harmful bias, ensure fair and equal treatment and access for individuals.

Responsible – be designed to enable responsible and accountable use, allow an understanding of the AI, and enable outcomes to be challenged.

Robust – be engineered to build in quality-testing, include safeguards to maintain functionality, and minimize misuse and impact of failure.
 
Every enterprise that seeks to use AI should establish an internal oversight group that understands and can help create guiding principles, evaluates use cases and technologies, and has the technologies in place to make assessments on ethical issues.

Designing a Brighter Future with AI

AI will be the most disruptive technology of our lifetime, and 2023 will be remembered as a historic technology inflection point. We must lean into AI to fuel the societal advancements it will make possible – while remaining vigilant in mitigating its risks.

It is incredible how much the world has transformed in recent years, and I maintain my optimism and confidence in a bright future accelerated by the superpowers of AI.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/07/the-superpowers-of-ai-come-with-great-responsibility.html,"IN THIS ARTICLE

HPE helps India improve healthcare with eHealth Centers,2023-03-21,"300+ eHealth Centers in 22 states, serve six million+ citizens; and help eradicate rare diseases like tuberculosis, hepatitis, and measles
India is home to more than 1.4 billion citizens and 14,000 HPE team members and while India has one of the largest Healthcare Systems in the world. There are still gaps in care, especially in rural areas and underserved communities. When routine healthcare became a crisis situation during the Covid pandemic, HPE had the systems in place to help. We asked, Ankur Malhotra, Director of Corporate Affairs and Corporate Social Responsibility, to speak to us about HPE’s impact in India during the pandemic and what’s next.

How did HPE become involved in eHealth Centers in 2012?

At HPE, we believe in transforming not only the way people work but also how they live. Our eHealth initiative was based on this vision. In 2012, our PointNext team was working on several solutions for the healthcare sector and had designed an open-source, cloud-based eHealth application which was adopted by the Corporate Social Responsibility team to deploy our first version of eHealth Centers. The idea was to provide quality healthcare to the most vulnerable section of our society and fill the void that exists in India with regards to primary healthcare.

How soon did we realize the centers needed to change from routine patient health to pandemic response?

In May 2020, we realized that our traditional eHealth Centers can play a role in mitigating the effects of Covid which was raging across India. Most hospitals were swamped with Covid patients and people with non-Covid diseases were being turned away from the hospitals. The public health ecosystem of the government was stretched to its limits. The need was to fill in the gaps which were created due to Covid, especially around outpatient treatments and testing. That was the time we started working with various government agencies to reorient our eHealth Centers into isolation centers and testing labs.

It took just over two months for HPE to design and deploy Covid-19 vaccination centers, what was that process like?

We were already working with the Institute for Genomics & Integrated Biology (IGIB) for our eHealth Centers, which is also the nodal agency for defining various protocols for Covid in India. They became our guide to design the Covid outpatient departments and test labs. We deployed 10 units to start with, designing them while being mindful to the ever-evolving Covid protocols.

By end of 2020, when the vaccination programs across the world were picking up momentum, we consulted IGIB again to see how we could contribute to the upcoming countrywide vaccination program. Once again, our existing network of eHealth Centers were evaluated, and we proceeded with converting them into vaccination centers using the guidelines issued by IGIB and other governmental agencies. As all our existing eHealth Centers were already cloud-enabled and had a biometric-enabled application running, so we were also able to seamlessly integrate with the CoWin network, the Indian government’s platform to digitally track vaccination status against common preventable diseases.

The technology implemented in the health centers can be integrated into any healthcare ecosystem and are reconfigurable for post-Covid health care needs. Is this currently happening?

Yes, it is. We have already reconverted several vaccination centers back into eHealth Centers with additional tech and equipment. We are also building linkages with governmental eHealth platforms like e-Sanjeevani to ensure that our network is fully integrated with the national public health infrastructure. In the coming months, more than 500 eHealth Centers will be fully functional and integrated into the national health pipeline.

What is next for our part in serving the underprivileged in India?

We are working with the United States Agency for International Development to utilize our eHealth Centers for tuberculosis detection and diagnosis. We are also creating a new concept called Health ATMs which would be a condensed version of our eHealth Centers. These Health ATMs would be able to support more than 50 diagnostic tests, have provisions for telemedicine and can be deployed anywhere, quickly. The idea is to reach those remote locations where traditional healthcare infrastructure does not exist today.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/03/hpe-helps-india-improve-healthcare-with-ehealth-centers.html,,"[""How has HPE's involvement in eHealth Centers impacted the healthcare system in India?\r"", 'What are the challenges faced by HPE in deploying eHealth Centers in rural areas and underserved communities?\r', ""How has HPE's technology helped in the fight against rare diseases like tuberculosis, hepatitis, and measles?\r""]","["" HPE's involvement in eHealth Centers has had a significant impact on the healthcare system in India.

"Get to know Monica Batchelder, HPE’s Chief Sustainability Officer",2023-04-24,"Monica Batchelder, HPE’s Chief Sustainability Officer, talks leadership, her passion for the environment, and how HPE is helping customers on their sustainability journeys
We had a chance to sit down with Monica and find out why she believes HPE is positioned to create a positive impact through sustainable technology. Did you always aspire to be a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)?

Becoming a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) was never part of a “master plan”. In fact, the role didn’t even exist when I was growing up, but my father encouraged me to be curious, to enjoy learning, and to spend time learning about the things that I was passionate about. Looking back, taking a more circuitous route to where I am today has proven to be a real asset in my job. That’s because CSOs need to employ a multidisciplinary approach to what we do. We need to make a challenge relevant to different stakeholders and drive innovation by connecting dots in new ways. We also need to be able to influence and gain buy-in without necessarily having formal authority. So, having had a diverse background really helps me work effectively between groups and cross-functional teams. In the end, investing time on the things that fascinated me has given me a breadth of experience that enables me to consider a challenge from multiple perspectives, and the ability to work with experts across multiple subject areas.  Where did your interest in sustainability begin?

I grew up in San Francisco, with a passion for the outdoors, spending time hiking, backpacking, and skiing. Looking back, that is what led me to pursue environmental science—long before I recognized that corporate sustainability could be a career, much less an imperative. What keeps me going is working with and learning from a diverse and dynamic team every day who share the deep sense of purpose, possibility, and responsibility that I do.

What excites you about being a sustainability leader within the technology sector?

The work we do is not only transforming our own business, it’s helping others advance their own sustainability missions. I’m proud to work at HPE because I truly believe that technology and innovation are the best and biggest ways that we can create a positive impact. The magnitude of the challenges facing the planet today requires the kind of rapidly scalable innovation only technology can deliver, and will require urgent, collaborative action from all sectors. As a global technology vendor in today’s digital-first economy, HPE is uniquely positioned to help reduce the footprint of IT while expanding the positive transformative impacts that technology can deliver.

What are some of the most significant levers that HPE can pull to address climate change?

We’re really focused on delivering sustainable IT solutions to our customers because this is ultimately where we can have the most significant impact toward our ambitious goal of reaching net-zero emissions across our value chain by 2040. Of course, our first priority is to minimize the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over which we have direct control – those that result from our company operations. However, these emissions actually comprise only a small share of our carbon footprint. Ultimately, we can only achieve our goals through strong, innovative partnerships— partnerships upstream with our suppliers and theirs, with our customers, and even with our peers and competitors to drive the industry transformation necessary. It’s invigorating to see how all these stakeholders—within and outside of HPE—are joining together to tackle the incredible challenge and opportunity that climate change poses.

Is there anything unique about your leadership style that you bring to the role?

I focus on using cross-disciplinary thinking and leverage my background in communications to help every person in an organization, no matter what their job, understand the relevance and significance of sustainability to their position. If everyone in the company can see how we can move the needle on sustainability, even a little bit, the collective impact really makes a huge difference. Since taking over as Chief Sustainability Officer last year, are there any specific focus areas that you’ve been driving?

An area I’ve been really focussed on driving has been to enhance and expand the sustainability expertise of our global workforce, especially of our sales teams. With the significant uptick in customer interest in sustainability, we knew that we needed our sales teams to be able to proactively identify opportunities where customers could achieve sustainability gains. Relying solely on our dedicated sustainability technologists in the Living Progress organization meant that we were missing opportunities in situations where sustainability simply had not been considered within the scope of the customer brief. Knowing how many of HPE’s technology solutions inherently carry sustainability advantages, I wanted to arm our sales teams with the knowledge and skills they needed to be able to present sustainable IT solutions early on in customer conversations – so that HPE had an opportunity to showcase not only how our technology contributes to our customer’s business benefits, but HPE’s commitment to sustainability as well. I’m really proud that my team has been at the forefront of taking sustainability from a box-ticking exercise to being a true differentiator in the marketplace that allows us to grow our business.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/04/get-to-know-monica-batchelder-hpes-chief-sustainability-officer.html,,"['Can you tell us more about the role of a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) and the responsibilities it entails?', ""How do you see HPE's role in driving innovation and reducing the footprint of IT in the technology sector?"", 'Can you share some examples of successful partnerships that HPE has formed with suppliers, customers, and peers to address climate change?']","["" The role of a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) is to lead and drive sustainability initiatives within an organization.

"Innovation, strategy, and execution drive exceptional profitability in Q2",2023-05-30,"Growth of Intelligent Edge, demand for AI offering and hybrid cloud innovation fuel performance
Today, HPE reported second quarter financial performance, and I am delighted that we continue to deliver strong results. In a market that continues to be dynamic, we delivered exceptional profitability. This demonstrates that our strategy to pivot our portfolio to higher-growth, higher margins areas is working, and we are operating with strong discipline. Here are a few highlights from the quarter:

 

HPE grew revenue 9%(1) year-over-year to $7.0 billion.

We achieved exceptional profitability in this fiscal quarter, generating our highest non-GAAP gross margin(2) ever and a non-GAAP operating margin(2) of 11.5%.

Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share(2) rose 18% year-over-year to 52 cents.

We raised GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance for the full fiscal year, reflecting continued confidence in our strategy and operational discipline.
 

Positioned in relevant markets to meet our customers’ needs

The strategic diversification of our portfolio is a clear strength in winning the business of customers who are taking a data-first approach to modernize their IT estates. The relevance of our strategy at the edge, in hybrid cloud, and in AI – delivered through our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform – is enabling us to navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment. Our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform continues to power the growth of our software, infrastructure, and services, capturing more than $10 billion in total contract value for the first time. HPE GreenLake also drove our annualized revenue run-rate (ARR)(3) to $1.1 billion – with an increasing portion of ARR coming from margin-rich software and services.

We continue to innovate on the HPE GreenLake platform. To complement our organic innovation, earlier this month we completed our acquisition of OpsRamp, whose hybrid digital operations management solutions have enhanced our HPE GreenLake platform by providing visibility, observability and control across multi-vendor and multi-cloud IT environments. With the integration of OpsRamp technology into HPE GreenLake in Q3, we entered a $39 billion IT Operations Management market(4).

HPE GreenLake is a performance driver across our portfolio, and we are seeing its value across our business segments. In nearly all of our key segments during the second quarter, we produced year-over-year revenue growth.

Continued performance at the edge

Intelligent Edge had a stand-out quarter. HPE Aruba Networking has exceeded our revenue and margin expectations, in part because customers are adding more cloud software services to recently delivered infrastructure, which will add to recurring revenue in future quarters. This is the second consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion in revenue in this segment, and the eleventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth.

We continue to drive innovation and expand our addressable market at the edge. Through our acquisition of cloud-security provider Axis Security, we have expanded our SASE – Secure Access Service Edge – offering, and with the soon-to-close purchase of Athonet, we are doubling down on private 5G. The combination of Axis Security, Athonet, and our world-class HPE Aruba intelligent edge capabilities gives HPE one of the most comprehensive, connected edge portfolios in the market. We expect this business to continue to grow in the quarters ahead. Customer demand for AI solutions

In our HPC & AI business, we saw a significant sequential increase in orders this quarter, with a noteworthy uptick across customer segments – from Fortune 500 companies to digital-native start-ups looking for optimized solutions for their large-scale-model development, training and inferencing. Customers are attracted to HPE’s market-leading supercomputing capabilities, differentiated interconnect IP, AI-specific software and services expertise.

This is a significant, profitable growth opportunity for HPE and our shareholders, in a space where HPE has unique differentiation – evident in the momentum in our business. Since the start of the second quarter, we have won multiple large contracts totaling more than $800 million from cloud providers and enterprise customers that will develop, train and run AI models.

In the quarter, we recognized a portion of the total revenue for our second exascale system – called Aurora – for the Argonne National Laboratory. Argonne will develop a series of generative AI models to run on the HPE Cray EX supercomputer.

In just a few weeks, we will host our annual HPE Discover customer and partner event in Las Vegas, where we will announce breakthrough innovations we anticipate will accelerate the demand for our portfolio, including our AI solutions. Innovation drives shareholder and customer value

We are executing our strategy and delivering strong results, including year-over-year revenue, margin growth, and expanded earnings. I am proud of our 60,000 team members whose commitment to bold thinking and innovation is helping our customers achieve their goals.

While the macro environment may introduce more uncertainty in the short term, I am confident that our winning strategy, diverse portfolio, and continued innovation position us well to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.

Bees are smart. How is tech making them “smarter”?,2023-05-24,"HPE’s Houston headquarters is home to tens of thousands of workers. Worker bees, that is. 
Busy at work, atop HPE’s headquarters, is a workforce unknown to many who work in the same building. A workforce made up of six beehives, producing honey, for good. In the same building that leads tech, for good. Amanda Pena, Houston Customer Innovation Center Manager, shares more on the bees purpose, and how tech helps keep the them thriving.

How did this project come about? What was the inspiration?

I have always been passionate about the environment but never thought of how I could make a difference beyond my home. When we opened the new global headquarters in Houston, I noticed we were getting a variety of bees visiting the plants on our terrace. Another HPE employee asked, “What do you plan to do about those?” and I jokingly replied, “Bring in more!”

As the wife of a Marine veteran, their mission is very near and dear to me. This project is sponsored by Dr. Renee Pizarro, Digital and Commercial Sales Sr. Director, and HPE’s Veterans Resource Group. We all partnered together with Hives for Heroes to make this project come to life.  What is the purpose of having a bee apiary atop HPE’s Headquarters?

At HPE we often hear messaging about being a force for good. I felt this would be a great way to demonstrate our culture and caring while introducing more pollinators to our ecosystem. You don’t normally think corporate and bee keeping or technology and bee keeping - but why couldn’t I change that point of view? HPE is utilizing technology to make the bees “smarter,” how?

This became an urgent pursuit for me when two of our hives lost their queens. The queen is a vital part of the hive and despite the workers and all the extra eggs, the colony could still die if the queen is lost. At this time of the year, there are no options for us to purchase a queen so I kept asking myself, “If I could have detected those queens were in distress, could I have changed my current situation?” What we know is the queen buzzes at a different pitch than the rest of the hive. Audio sensors with AI could have picked up on her stress or detected her absence much sooner.

Being a tech company, I wanted to tap into what we do best. We have been working with the HPE Ezmeral team and using data to upgrade our hives to “smart hives.” Sensors and data allow for remote assessment to monitor the health of the hives between beekeeper visits. We also share our data with universities that offer master beekeeping programs to continue mind sharing on the topic.How do we connect with the community and team members in this initiative? What are some of the ways we give back through this project?

Houston team members can sign up to participate and meet our master beekeeper and a “newbee,” a veteran from our community learning about beekeeping. This project also provides an opportunity to uniquely engage in a safe setting with our bees, each other, and our team member families.

A portion of honey harvested will be donated to Goodr (a local food kitchen), and a portion sold at Bayou Brew.  A percentage of those proceeds will be then donated to local charities nominated by the Houston employee resource groups.  

 

What’s next – are there any plans to expand, or other projects in the works?

Yes! More hives, fingers crossed, and possibly scoping how we can help other sites maintain their own hives. We have even had customers express interest in having their own hives after visiting our site.

"Get to know Bobby Ford, HPE’s Chief Security Officer",2023-02-22,"Learning more about Bobby's career path, his advice for others, and what he does in his down time
Leading the charge to ensure HPE’s digital and physical assets are always protected is his primary job. Being passionate about football and a stickler for designer shoes is part of his alter-ego.

We had a chance to catch up with Bobby and get to know him a little better.  What is the best thing about working in IT security?

Information security, or cybersecurity, is a really cool field. It’s an industry that's been around for more than 30 years, and it's still at the beginning. It is fast-paced and continually evolving, so there is always more that we need to understand.  This is also why companies continue to invest heavily in IT security.

What advice would you have for someone who wants to get into IT security?

I would say understand how truly broad a topic it is and don't be intimidated by the technical aspects of it.  When you think of cybersecurity, you shouldn't immediately think tech. There are different functions and so many different roles that exist in cybersecurity, and not all of them are deeply technical.

What excites you about working in this field, specifically at HPE?

I believe that we are truly transforming the way people consume and view technology. Being at HPE, we are helping an entire industry transform. Very rarely do you get an opportunity to be part of something this big, and I'm thankful to be here.

What drives you as a chief security officer?

The opportunity to protect our data, to protect our assets, and essentially, to protect our business, is what drives me. People tend to think that security is synonymous with defense. I love that theory because if you are a sports fan, you already know that defense wins the championships.

You’re a self-proclaimed designer shoe aficionado. Tell us more.

I love fashion. I think it stems from my parents.  They were into fashion and made sure we always looked our best at church, the first day of school, and other big events. So, it stuck with me, especially shoes.  I think the most significant part of anyone's fashion is their shoes, and I can tell a lot about an individual based on their shoe game.

How AI is changing the game for Evil Geniuses,2023-06-06,"Chris DeAppolonio, Chief Innovation Officer at Evil Geniuses discusses the transformative impact of AI on the esports industry with Mark Hourani, HPE’s AI and Data Practice Lead
Evil Geniuses (EG), a prominent esports organization, leverages AI to improve team performance. Analyzing large amounts of gaming, video and audio data helps EG enhance team skills, create winning strategies, and discover talented players. Mark Hourani, HPE’s AI and Data Practice Lead, chatted with Chris DeAppolonio, Chief Innovation Officer at Evil Geniuses to hear how it’s done.

Q1: (Mark) Chris, can you briefly share the progress made in advancing Evil Geniuses’ AI program and achieving goals with the support of HPE Services consultants over the past six months?

A1: (Chris) Our first use case focused on combining audio, video, and gaming stats for our League of Legends team. We then proceeded to build a foundational AI & Data platform for future use cases using an HPE GreenLake private cloud platform. The platform, models, and web application we developed have revolutionized our approach to the draft process in League of Legends, enabling our coaches to identify winning combinations and counter opponent choices. When you think of sports teams setting the pace with analytics, the A's, Rockets, Liverpool all come to mind. I think with HPE, Evil Geniuses is in that same breath when it comes to esports.

Q2: (Mark) Can you comment on how our teams were able to move you to the new environment and build out the MVP in just 3 weeks, in time for the playoffs?

A2: (Chris) Yes, it was incredible; a testament to how well our teams have worked together. This is complex work featuring even more complex data. I would add that our team has learned a lot of best practices from HPE experts. This will allow us to be more productive and build new models on our own. The HPE GreenLake platform allows us to build portable code using opensource tools without being locked into proprietary tools, all while being highly cost efficient. This is important for an esports organization as we are dealing with budgets far lower than traditional professional sports teams.

Q3: (Mark) What sort of impact have you seen? Q4: (Mark) Did the draft analysis solution provide added value to your playoffs?

A4: (Chris) Our team analysts found great value in the draft analysis tool, using it extensively to prepare for high-stakes matches. Although our playoff results didn't meet our expectations, the analysts confirmed that our draft choice strategy was correct. Given the frequent updates in game versions and the impact on Champion strength, it is crucial for us to quickly understand these changes and their effect on team composition. With over 160 Champions to consider, it's challenging to compile the optimal combinations, but the tool significantly aids in this process. By collecting data from ranked games and scrims, our draft analysis can analyze permutations and assist us in making the best choices.

Q5: (Mark) How do you foresee the impact of using AI in similar ways to optimize results in an enterprise setting and what are your plans for the future?

A5: (Chris) I definitely see these concepts applying to all companies. Evaluating communications and actions with the intent to improve performance, it just makes sense. Communication is still the backbone for many businesses but a lot more could be done in that realm. We have started talking to HPE about generative AI, reinforcement learning, and other novel concepts. But, unlike other sports teams, we play in multiple titles and so while we have accomplished a lot for League of Legends in a short amount of time there is massive greenspace for AI to be utilized to help our three other teams.

Be sure to join us at HPE Discover and see Chris DeAppolonio, Chief Innovation Officer at Evil Geniuses, live onstage at the Session Spotlight, SL5622, Understand one thing: Digital ambition is only met by reimagining your operating model.

4 top questions being addressed at Mobile World Congress 2023,2023-02-28,"Tom Craig, GM of HPE Communications Technology Group, addresses four major challenges impacting telcos at the show
1.       How can telcos generate new revenue from networks?

The challenge of monetizing their network infrastructure is one that telcos have been grappling with for years. Technology companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook continue to expand their offerings into the telecoms space, putting increased pressure on telcos to create value beyond the ‘dumb pipe’ and deliver new services that can generate revenue. The average revenue per user (ARPU) has also plateaued, with consumers unwilling to pay more for a new network, whether it’s 4G or 5G.  Telcos are under pressure to generate new revenue from their networks and boost their top line revenue.

It's no secret that one of the biggest revenue opportunities for telcos is in the enterprise B2B space, particularly with the advent of private 5G networks.  Enterprises are demanding a customised 5G experience with low-latency, segregated resources, extended range and security that complements their existing wireless networks. Telcos are looking for simple ways to deploy private 5G networks to meet this growing customer expectation at the connected edge. The enterprise needs to be convinced that private cellular networks can be efficiently deployed and managed. To do this, telcos need to be able to partner with companies that can help them deliver end-to-end private networks, using cost-effective and best-in-class technology that’s fit for purpose. 

That is what HPE is delivering today – a holistic approach to delivering private networks that make it simple for telcos to service this market, and in turn give enterprises the confidence to leverage this technology. Moving quickly to exploit the enterprise private network market will be crucial if operators want to start turning a profit from their network and their expertise. With the acquisition of Athonet giving HPE one of the most complete private 5G and Wi-Fi portfolios, we are well placed to support both telcos and enterprises on their private networking journeys.

2.       How do telcos reduce network costs?

Achieving greater levels of efficiency across all levels of the network is crucial for telcos to maintain their ability to generate free cash flow and stay afloat in a highly capital-intensive industry.

The capital intensity of telcos has been exceptionally high for decades, with the average Capex-to-sales ratio hovering at around 14% and showing no signs of decreasing. This is due to the continuous doubling of network traffic every 18 months or so, necessitating the addition of more infrastructure to accommodate the increased demand. This in turn incurs additional operational expenses and personnel to manage the new infrastructure. Telcos have tried various measures to address this issue, including outsourcing and network sharing, but these have not provided a significant solution.

However, automation is beginning to revolutionize the economics of running a network. Vodafone’s CTO recently said that automation has saved it €500m in three years. Automation can be achieved end-to-end, from the core all the way to the RAN, with cloud solutions that enable telcos to manage their infrastructure regardless of how widely distributed it is. With the implementation of automation, telcos can realize substantial benefits, reducing costs and catering to the ever-increasing capital demands of the industry.

3.       What is the right cloud strategy for telcos?

One of the big opportunities that telcos are assessing today is the public cloud. IT and some network elements that would have been hosted in a private cloud, can now be moved into a public cloud. Telcos are now determining whether this infrastructure can deliver desired business outcomes.

What many telcos are realizing is that this shift to the cloud offers benefits but is not without its challenges. One major challenge is the loss of control over data since it is no longer hosted on-premise. Another is latency, and the time it takes for data to be sent to and from a public cloud, and processed in that environment. It is for these reasons, that we believe the future for telecoms is hybrid cloud, with telcos using the most appropriate cloud environment for different experiences.

As telcos look to leverage different cloud environments, they want a single pane of glass that gives them full control of the data across their different cloud and IT infrastructures, also with the ability to monitor network performance, such as latency. That is exactly why I’m excited about what HPE GreenLake for Telco Cloud is delivering for telcos today - empowering them to move to hybrid cloud environments, without losing control of their customers.

4.       How to reduce energy consumption at the network edge?

With the introduction of distributed computing, more data is being generated at the edge of the network. While modern infrastructure, like the HPE ProLiant DL110 platform, offers heavily reduced power consumption, to make a fundamental change a rethink in how data is handled is required.  Most power is consumed in the transport and processing of data to get some useful outcome. If telcos and their enterprise clients analyse data at the edge of the network, rather than processing it in a centralized environment, they’re not wasting energy transporting data back and forth that they may not use. Therefore, the overall network becomes more efficient. Once telcos have the capability to offer distributed edge-to-cloud capabilities, they can provision AI and data analysis at the edge of the network, processing data captured from 5G and Wi-Fi simultaneously.

With HPE's help, telcos can navigate the challenges and opportunities facing the industry and emerge as leaders in the telecommunications landscape. We look forward to discussing these and other issues at MWC and beyond.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/02/4-top-questions-being-addressed-at-mobile-world-congress-2023.html,,"['How can telcos leverage private 5G networks to generate new revenue?\r', 'What are the benefits of automation in reducing network costs for telcos?\r', 'How can telcos balance the benefits of public cloud with the challenges of data control and latency?\r']","[' Telcos can leverage private 5G networks to generate new revenue by offering customized 5G experiences to enterprises with low-latency, segregated resources, extended range, and security that complements their existing wireless networks.

Hewlett Packard Labs receives two DOE Fusion initiative awards projects,2023-09-06,"Hewlett Packard Labs and General Atomics accelerate commercialization of fusion energy
Meeting the challenges of climate change and building a carbon-free energy grid will require a combination of green energy solutions. Wind, solar, hydroelectric and nuclear (fission) power will all play a role in creating a carbon-free energy grid that powers the world of the near future. Potentially, humanity will also require energy derived from nuclear fusion – the very power source of stars like our sun, and one that has thus far vexed humanity’s greatest minds. But we’ve made significant progress.

Scientists around the world have gotten closer to finding a way to harness the promising power of fusion. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has recently awarded several multi-million-dollar grants as part of its “machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data resources for fusion energy sciences” initiative. Hewlett Packard Labs (Labs), the applied research organization within Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), will have a groundbreaking role in two of these projects in collaboration with General Atomics and the University of Rochester. These projects will be led by HPE Fellow and Vice President Dr. Paolo Faraboschi, who leads the AI Research Lab at Hewlett Packard Labs. Hewlett Packard Labs and General Atomics accelerate commercialization of fusion energy

The pace of fundamental research in plasma physics must accelerate for scientists to better understand how to create stable conditions in a fusion reactor relevant for energy production. Put simply, a Fusion Pilot Plant (FPP) must sustain plasmas at temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius – approximately 10 times the temperature at the center of the sun. Keeping that energy system stable has proved to be one of modern science’s greatest mysteries.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods can help scientists achieve research goals that will help solve that mystery. However, AI workflows are complex and available data are not in a form directly suitable for their use to build AI models for the FPP design and control.

The DOE identified a need to develop infrastructures for managing, formatting, curating and enabling access to fusion data for development of AI/ML algorithms. It selected a multi-institutional team of data scientists led by General Atomics (GA) to develop a Fusion Data Platform (FDP) to advance fusion research. The FDP will provide researchers with access to high-quality fusion data for the efficient creation of reproducible AI and ML models that will support design and operation of FPPs in coming decades.

GA will partner with Labs, the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) and SapientAI to create the FDP, which the scientific community will ultimately tap to support rapid advancements in FPP designs. Specifically, Dr. Martin Foltin and his team at Labs will contribute expertise in AI/ML data and algorithms to make large-scale fusion data easier to access and analyze through the FDP.

Labs has developed a Common Metadata Framework that makes it easier to discover data that is suitable for building fusion models. It enables reproducible and reusable workflows to help bootstrap and focus fusion research and advances the development of certifiable models and management of their lifecycles. For mission-critical applications, it is important to capture model provenance (the entire history and processing steps that led to the creation of a model) for auditability and certifiability.

The work with General Atomics is crucial because it will accelerate the commercialization of fusion energy, and the team at Labs is excited to play an important role in helping to achieve objectives on the decadal vision roadmap toward fusion energy. Hewlett Packard Labs revolutionizing Inertial Confinement Fusion with University of Rochester

To build upon the historic fusion ignition breakthrough in 2022 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), scientists around the world have been actively advancing their research in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), or more colloquially “laser fusion.” The University of Rochester’s Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE) is a leader and a key partner in the ICF program. Scientists from LLE are actively engaged in developing laser-driven ICF technology, and their approach involves targeting multiple lasers at small spherical shells or pellets filled with fusion materials, such as deuterium and tritium, to initiate a fusion reaction. This process of firing lasers to produce large energy is a major scientific challenge, and expensive to setup, which limits the number of experiments. To address this challenge, researchers simulate the system to identify the optimal parameters of the experiment. There is an urgent need to bridge the gap between running computational simulations of this process at different fidelities and the experimental design, which deviate significantly. This requires using the power of AI to transfer the learning from these multi-fidelity simulations to physical experiments to help improve the design.

Labs’ AI/ML experts led by Senior Distinguished Technologist Soumyendu Sarkar will work directly with LLE’s fusion scientists to build predictive algorithms using transfer-learning and Reinforcement Learning. This will help accurately guide implosion design and predict experimental outcomes. The objective is to cost effectively run more laser simulations at different fidelities to advance the speed of research and improve the design of the physical lasers. 

Humanity needs carbon-free energy to continue to propel its evolution and innovation while protecting the planet from the devastating effects of climate change. It will take a variety of energy sources and the greatest thinkers to meet that generational and existential challenge. In these two fusion projects with GA and LLE, Labs will use its AI/ML expertise to embrace its role in securing a better, more sustainable future for all.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/09/hewlett-packard-labs-receives-two-doe-fusion-initiative-awards-projects.html,"IN THIS ARTICLE

2. HPE as a Service (aaS) offerings help organizations digitally transform and modernize sustainably. Over decades we have focused on the environmental impacts of our solutions and have built one of the most innovative Sustainable IT portfolios.  Along with our expertise and services, our holistic solutions aim to lower the carbon impact of IT, reducing energy consumption and optimizing utilization while delivering speed and performance.  HPE GreenLake –the centerpiece of our edge to cloud strategy, enables customers to consume IT on an as-a-service basis, enabling them to flexibly scale their IT to meet their needs and reducing IT inefficiencies which are a significant source of environmental impacts within many companies.  HPE is continually innovating and recently announced the preview of a new sustainability dashboard on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform and a comprehensive portfolio of sustainability services designed to help organizations reduce the carbon footprint associated with their IT estates.  In addition, in June 2022, 96 HPE systems made the Green 500 list of the world’s most energy efficient supercomputers, with Frontier coming in as #1. 

We also help customers benefit from the circular economy and give technology that would otherwise be discarded a new life. Over the last three years, HPE Financial Services returned to active use more than 3.1 million personal computers, 2.4 million servers and compute assets, and 800,000 storage devices. In 2022, HPE Technology Renewal Centers processed ~3.6 million IT assets, remarketing 82% for a second life. 3. Maintaining our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. We are committed to being an unconditionally inclusive workplace where everyone is respected. HPE continues to advance principles of diversity, equity and inclusion both within its workforce and beyond. In 2022, 50% of our board members identified with one or more diverse groups and found that 96% of team members reported feeling respected at HPE. In addition, we met our goal of increasing the representation of ethnically diverse talent by 1 percentage point year-over-year, and 36.3% of US promotions were earned by ethnically diverse team members, which is four percentage points higher than overall representation. HPE also achieved its goal, for the 2nd year in a row, of increasing representation of women in executive roles (director level and above) by at least 1 percentage point.

4. We operate with integrity. HPE continues to demonstrate that we are a trusted supplier and partner helping companies advance solutions that make big ideas possible. In 2022 we launched three new supply chain responsibility targets related to worker training, worker voice, and no recruitment fee and reached 235,533 workers in our supply chain through our monitoring programs.

HPE appoints Simon Ewington to lead Worldwide Partner and Channel Ecosystem,2023-08-24,"Simon Ewington named VP, WW Channel & Partner Ecosystem 
I am pleased to share that Simon Ewington has been named Vice President, WW Channel & Partner Ecosystem for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In this role, Simon will drive efforts to expand business opportunities for our partners while accelerating HPE’s edge-to-cloud strategy.

The right leader at the right time

At the beginning of the year, Simon was named as the interim leader, while also maintaining his leadership role as VP of WW Distribution, as we conducted a thorough search for a permanent leader.

Simon is an incredible leader, with more than 27-years of experience at HP and HPE, along with a wealth of channel experience in both the regional and global partner ecosystem roles. Simon is well respected for his people leadership skills, his strategic expertise and his strength in execution. While serving in the role on an interim basis, Simon has led the team in accelerating HPE’s as-a-service momentum. The team has also delivered new offerings in the HPE Partner Ready Vantage program, including announcing in June at the HPE Partner Growth Summit enhanced opportunities and solutions to increase partner opportunities to capitalize on mega trends around Edge, Hybrid Cloud and AI. Simon has led the organization in delivering on these efforts while remaining focused on driving process changes to improve the partner experience. 

HPE has great momentum within the partner ecosystem and we are committed to continued investment. Through Q2 of this fiscal year, HPE GreenLake orders maintained the strong momentum we have seen with partners in the market. Our Edge business with HPE Aruba Networking continues to deliver strong growth through partners. And we are continuing to invest in these key areas, as well as within our Storage and Compute areas of the business, aligning with customer needs.

Simon will continue to drive the team’s efforts to build on our momentum, deliver against the HPE Partner Ready Vantage program, and help guide partners in leveraging the opportunity of the HPE GreenLake Cloud platform to align with customer outcomes and requirements. A strong leadership bench, edge-to-cloud

This appointment builds on leadership announcements we have made over the last several months as we continue to invest in supporting and further growing our partner ecosystem.

Recently, Leve Skov was announced as Vice President of Worldwide Channel Sales for HPE Aruba Networking. She is focused on evolving and growing our channel programs with a laser focus on supplying the comprehensive tools and support partners and the channel community need for success in this changing business environment.

Uli Seibold was appointed the new Vice President of HPE GreenLake Partner and Service Provider Sales. In this role, Uli is increasing the breadth and depth of HPE GreenLake within our channel partners and doubling down on our service provider strategy.

Empower your sustainable IT strategy with HPE this Earth Day,2023-04-19,"Monica Batchelder is participating in a livestreamed panel discussion with other sustainable IT experts from HPE
Earth Day is an annual reminder of the commitments we’ve made to reduce our environmental impact to the planet, to take stock of progress we’ve made, and to continually strive to leave a livable planet for future generations. In today’s digital world, sustainable IT can play a significant role for enterprises to fulfill these environmental commitments, which is why HPE sees sustainability as inextricably linked to our business strategy.

In celebration of Earth Day, I’ll be participating in a livestreamed panel discussion with other sustainable IT experts from HPE to help our customers, partners and team members understand the most pressing sustainability challenges facing IT organizations. My colleagues Tiffani Jarnigan, Director, Sustainability Innovation and Partnerships, John Frey, Chief Technologist, Sustainable Transformation, and Brian Falvey, Vice President of Sales, HPE GreenLake North America, will join me for a robust discussion hosted by Mike Hilton, Managing Director of HPE Canada, about how HPE solutions empower users to take charge of their IT estate’s impact on the planet.

How HPE is helping companies implement sustainable IT solutions

Growing pressure on organizations to reduce carbon emissions has led to an uptick in companies integrating sustainability into their business models and an increase in questioning how they can incorporate sustainability into their digital transformation journeys. With the growing environmental footprint associated with IT, Chief Information Officers are increasingly being held accountable for achieving large emission reduction targets. This is where the decades of expertise HPE has in delivering sustainable IT systems and solutions can support companies’ sustainability agendas. The race to achieving net-zero emissions can only be won together, as our carbon footprints are interconnected in so many ways.

Linking it all together – sustainability strategy becomes business strategy

HPE is committed to becoming a net-zero enterprise across our entire value chain by the year 2040, and a large part of achieving that goal comes from reducing scope 3 emissions, which are out of our direct span of control. In fact, the largest portion of our footprint is generated from customers’ use of our products and solutions. That makes partnering with our customers a critical part of our journey to net-zero. By accelerating our customers’ digital transformations, we are solving their business and sustainability goals, without compromise. We encourage our customers to see value, not compliance requirements, when thinking about sustainability. Becoming a more sustainable enterprise is a catalyst for change and transformation. Companies that link digital transformation with sustainability are 2.51 times more likely to be among tomorrow’s strongest-performing businesses than those that do not. Sustainability is increasingly becoming a prerequisite for doing business, with a growing number of enterprises tying contract awards to the environmental performance of the solutions they’re purchasing.

Shrinking the environmental footprint of hybrid IT

While public cloud offers sustainability benefits, not all apps and data can be put in the public cloud. Analysts point out that, despite the benefits of public cloud, the world remains decidedly hybrid. According to IDC, 70% of apps and data remain in data centers, colocations, and edges, for reasons like low latency needs, data governance policies, sovereignty, compliance, or the entangled applications typical of traditional IT. Organizations are faced with dual challenges: the first being to manage data and workloads across complex hybrid architectures, and the second being to design and operate a hybrid IT system with efficiency in mind that is able to meet the mounting sustainability requirements facing IT today. This is where IT-as-a-service can offer a simplified IT solution that gives users the ability to drive down energy use and save money by optimizing workloads and utilization rates. HPE’s flagship offering, HPE GreenLake, provides customers a cloud-native experience to power their hybrid strategy, while empowering them to reduce their environmental footprint, not only through the inherent benefits of a scalable workload solution, but also through additional environmental reduction opportunities such as HPE’s end-of-life asset recovery program.

By pulling all the levers available to them, CIOs can be the sustainability heroes of their organization – public or private, large or small. That’s why heading into Earth Day, I’m more energized than ever to lead the team of professionals dedicated to enabling every part of our company to contribute to solving one of the greatest challenges of our time: climate change.

HPE showcases security initiatives via the 2023 Cybersecurity Report,2023-04-06,"The HPE 2023 Cybersecurity Report shares how we protect our company and deliver a secure edge-to-cloud experience for customers
Delivering a secure HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud experience is paramount to HPE, our customers and our partners. As we continue to support organizations shifting to hybrid cloud, we see the security of cloud platforms as a shared responsibility, and that takes collaboration. In that spirit of collaboration, we also believe in sharing learnings, ideas, and opportunities with our customers and the cybersecurity community at large.

Our 2023 Cybersecurity Report showcases some of the initiatives HPE has undertaken to meet challenges we all face, such as protecting an expanding attack surface, securing the hybrid cloud environment, providing transparency for stakeholders, and growing cybersecurity talent. The report is also a means to share our expertise and collaborate with the industry on our collective experiences. Below are some highlights from the report.

Facing the daily threats: Similar to other global technology companies, we are a constant target for cyber criminals. In fact, our security operations center logs over 2.6 billion events per day. Our report discusses the threats we face every day and how we manage them – from phishing and ransomware to supply chain attacks and nation-state actors.

It also delves into our increased focus on the edge-to-cloud environment and what we’re doing to protect our customers with a risk-based, compliance-driven approach to data security. The HPE GreenLake Cloud Platform continuously applies more than 2,200 separate security controls to protect customers and their data in real time.

Closing the experience gap: All enterprises are feeling the squeeze of increased competition for talent. At HPE, we’re reframing the cybersecurity talent shortage as an experience shortage and in the report, we talk how we aim to we create - rather than take - talent. Last year, we launched the HPE Cybersecurity Career Reboot program, which seeks talent in unlikely places and is designed to both gift opportunities, and to grow our ranks of cybersecurity professionals.

Looking into the future: Our report provides insights from cybersecurity subject matter experts around HPE on the trends they’re seeing from their unique perspectives. For instance, Brian Schmitt, our associate general counsel, predicts: “CISOs, CSOs, and other security professionals will increasingly be held personally accountable for their failures to provide required breach disclosures or to adequately secure sensitive data.”

Taking action: We share a set of recommendations for building cyber resilience and embracing zero trust within your organization. For example, we believe that enterprises must connect security teams more closely with the business. Only then can they fully understand the risks to the organization and successfully mitigate them.

I truly believe cybersecurity is a collective responsibility that takes all of us. The 2023 Cybersecurity Report shares insights from HPE but is intended to spark ideas and conversation.

HPE also uses advanced analytics and machine learning to detect and respond to potential threats in real time, and works closely with customers to understand their unique security needs and develop customized solutions to meet those needs.

The program is designed to provide training, mentorship, and networking opportunities to individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those who may have left the workforce for other reasons or who may not have had access to traditional cybersecurity education or training. The program also seeks to attract individuals who may not have considered a career in cybersecurity due to a lack of awareness or understanding of the field. Overall, the HPE Cybersecurity Career Reboot program is intended to help individuals develop the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the cybersecurity industry, while also helping to address the talent shortage that is currently impacting the field.']"

"Elana Tyrangiel, HPE’s Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, discusses inaugural Human Rights Report",2023-06-27,"HPE has published its inaugural Human Rights report, learn more about it by checking out the Q&A below
Today Hewlett Packard Enterprise released our first ever Human Rights Report. We want to win the right way, every day, which means maintaining steadfast commitments to ethics, transparency, and responsible business practices. This report reflects these values and showcases our progress. Implementing strong human rights protections is how we live our values and an essential part of fulfilling our purpose to advance the way people live and work.

HPE’s Global Human Rights Policy, aligned to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, has long been among the most robust in the industry. We also recognize that safeguarding human rights in our value chain is a process of continuous improvement. Over the last few years, we’ve made many improvements to drive our business and industry toward even higher standards. To name a few, HPE:
 

Adopted and operationalized principles for the ethical development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence (AI)

Set social impact goals for our supply chain

Collaborated with peers and other stakeholders to promote worker well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic

Launched an Anti-slavery Volunteering Initiative with non-profits around the world

Built our internal processes for identifying, assessing, and mitigating sales with a potential risk of product misuse
 

We sat down with Elana Tyrangiel, HPE’s Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, to discuss the report and HPE’s approach to human rights.

Why are you publishing this report now, and what are some highlights?

HPE’s leadership is prioritizing human rights, and our stakeholders including investors and customers are asking for detailed disclosures on our practices and impact. We hope that this report will not only keep us accountable and push us to continue to better our processes, but also encourage our peers to be more transparent. This report also provides a one-stop-shop for sharing all key human rights due diligence and a way to hold ourselves accountable to demonstrating our progress and effectiveness.

The report explores our approach and impact related to our updated list of six salient human rights risks: responsible product development; responsible use; modern slavery and decent work; responsible sourcing of minerals; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.  HPE has a long tradition of transparency (for instance, see our recently released Living Progress report), and because human rights is a priority for us, a report made sense. 

How does HPE incorporate human rights throughout the organization?

HPE incorporates respect for human rights throughout our organization – starting from the very top. We consider human rights in so many aspects of our business—from how we source materials used in the manufacture of our products, to our customers’ end use of our products, to how we treat and train our own team members. We are also deeply involved with industry groups such as the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) to harness the power of collective action across our industry and beyond.

How does HPE consider the views of third parties HPE’s in upholding human rights?

The views of third-party stakeholders are always important in how we go about addressing human rights impacts. The most valuable opinions are those of rights-holders, such as representatives of vulnerable groups, who provide meaningful feedback that helps us to continuously improve our processes and adjust our priorities to meet their needs. Recently, we identified and engaged with a series of rights-holder representatives and topical experts to get feedback on our understanding and approach to managing risks to specific vulnerable groups. Their ideas and constructive feedback helped us focus our projects in a more impactful way,  launch our work to understand and drive positive impact through clean, healthy, and sustainable environment as a human right, apply a vulnerable groups lens to every human rights impact assessment we do, and inform and improve our Commitment to Respect the Rights of Marginalized Groups.

Workers are also critical partners. We have prioritized worker engagement, introducing new ways to gather regular feedback from workers at key supplier sites. Worker feedback offers invaluable insights into areas such as supplier pay systems, living wages, and the inextricable link between wages and working hours. We also value how independent organizations view our program. A range of organizations have recognized HPE’s leadership on human rights. These recognitions include:

 

First place ranking among global ICT companies in KnowTheChain in 2022

First place ranking in Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB) ICT benchmark and placed in the top 5 across all industries (covering 127 of the world’s largest companies) in 2022

96th percentile for human rights and 100th percentile for social reporting in the Dow Jones’ Sustainability Index (DJSI), securing overall second place in our industry in 2022

Five-time consecutive recipient of Ethisphere’s Most Ethical Companies recognition, starting with 2019

Only repeat winner of the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s Stop Slavery Award, 2016 and 2021
 

Recognition by third-party organizations that specialize in measuring processes and reporting helps us make sure we are on the right path. These validate that the programs we’ve put in place are working and help guide us in our journey to continue making progress across our company and supply chain.

How does HPE maintain ethical standards with the growing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

In 2022, we refined our approach to assessing ethical AI and rolled out AI Ethical Principles training for HPE team members. In 2023, we further advanced this initiative by launching three new sub-committees to help us operationalize our principles for AI we develop (products), AI we source to use (processes), and AI we source to incorporate into our solutions (partners).

AI ethics assessments are at the core of the responsible product development program. We leverage team members’ awareness and internal alert mechanisms to identify potential use of AI internally and in new products and partnerships that may pose a risk to human rights, and our AI Ethics Working Group works with those partners to assess risk and recommend mitigation measures. Our widely promoted training and principles provide an avenue for raising awareness and building human rights by design with product and solutions teams and business partners.As the world keeps changing and new risks are identified, and rights-holders voice new priorities, we work to put processes in place to provide solutions. Our goal is to be a force for good in the world and we believe that responsibility must be taken seriously and upheld throughout our organization and our value chain.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/06/elana-tyrangiel-hpes-chief-ethics-compliance-officer-discusses-inaugural-human-rights-report.html,"IN THIS ARTICLE

HPE Financial Services launches new offers for companies leading the way in sustainability,2023-02-23,"New offerings aim to help drive circularity and sustainability within IT market
Sustainability and circularity are gaining IT leaders’ attention, and it is a good thing. In fact, IDC estimates that by 2026, 60% of organizations will require their IT equipment vendors and partners to provide end-to-end visibility of their sustainability process.1

At HPE Financial Services, we recognize that now is a critical time for companies to advance their approach to sustainability, and we are working to help them on this journey, with improved IT economics and circular solutions.

This is why I’m happy to share that today, HPEFS is announcing the introduction of a special financing offer available to companies recognized for their demonstrated commitment to sustainability.2

It is also offering global onsite decommissioning services for HPE Asset Upcycling customers and expanding the HPE Certified Pre-owned portfolio with Nimble Gen 5 Storage.

Sustainability is a catalyst for businesses and our first announcement is focused on rewarding companies that have demonstrated commitment in sustainability. HPE is extending incentives towards new, qualified small and mid-sized business (SMB) and enterprise customers that have an ESG score within a pre-determined range of a recognized industry standard index. These organizations can receive special financing rates.2 As part of our ongoing strategy to help drive circularity within IT and reduce e-waste, HPEFS now offers onsite decommissioning services in 31 countries for HPE Asset Upcycling Services. These onsite services securely decommission IT assets for refurbishment and reuse, or recycling. Data sanitization services can be included, which can help customers align with their privacy standards on their own premises. HPE Services or carefully selected partners deliver these onsite decommissioning services for HPE Asset Upcycling Services.

Additionally, the HPE Certified Preowned portfolio continues to expand and now includes Nimble Gen 5 Storage for customers in the U.S. and Canada, with additional countries to be announced subsequently. Refurbished tech is a critical way companies can lower capital expenditures and accelerate IT projects. As Monica Batchelder, HPE Chief Sustainability Officer points out: “Certified pre-owned is a great option since it avoids much of the embodied emissions that a new product would generate. Extending the life of technology is an excellent way of reducing that impact since it was captured in its first lifecycle.”

Sustainable IT is a journey for us and our customers, and HPE is dedicated to leading the industry by offering world-class solutions and services to our customers and partners. These expanded offerings are important to helping customers and partners optimize their IT estate for efficiency and visibility and maximize the value of asset lifecycles. Technology financing can be key to SMBs staying competitive and meeting sustainability goals

Business leaders are facing another year of global economic uncertainty. Nearly 3/4s of US CEOs believe they need to invest more aggressively in digital technologies. At the same time, 70 percent of global tech leaders are concerned about the cost of technology to remain competitive.3

When faced with the costs of digital transformation and increasing expectations around sustainability, SMBs are among the most at risk of falling behind, especially in the current context of constrained supply, high-interest capital, and tighter environmental regulations.

With an eye towards SMBs, as well as enterprise customers, HPEFS Force For Good Financing Program:
 

Delivers special financing to qualified customers that meet a pre-determined ESG score range within a recognized industry standard index2

Favors adoption of the newer more energy efficient products including HPE ProLiant Gen11 servers4, as well as HPE Data Center and HP Inc. personal systems

Offers the option to include HPE’s Pack-and-Ship services to simplify the return process for end-of-lease assets and help drive circularity in their tech estate

Also included in this offer is the HPE Circular Economy Report so the company can track and observe its contribution to its technology sustainability efforts
 

I’ve been in technology financing and services for some time now, and the groundswell of sustainability-focused initiatives in the last few years is inspiring. There is not one conversation with customers or partners where we don’t discuss this topic, and I’m hopeful that as companies and as leaders, we continue to collaborate to accelerate those efforts.

In parts of the world, the adage is to ""water where it grows.” Through initiatives like our Force For Good Financing Program, the plan is to continue growing strong, competitive businesses that are prioritizing sustainability in their long-term business strategies.

Evolving our operating model to deliver a superior customer and partner experience,2023-09-19,"Accelerating our strategy and execution
I said during my first days as CEO that the enterprise of the future would be edge-centric, cloud-enabled, and data-driven. That vision from nearly six years ago has turned into strategy, then innovation, and ultimately into strong momentum for HPE and business outcomes for customers and partners in every industry.

Recognizing the world would be hybrid, we introduced HPE GreenLake, and we have made great strides in aligning one integrated platform, one customer experience, and a portfolio of solutions under one brand.  The scale and strength of HPE GreenLake is evident; it supports 27,000 unique customer logos and 3.4 million connected devices. HPE GreenLake is at the center of how we implement our edge-to-cloud strategy.

Having laid the foundation for success, we are now evolving our operating model to accelerate our execution, deliver a superior customer and partner experience, and drive growth for the company and value for our shareholders. These changes to HPE’s organizational structure and executive leadership, which take effect at the start of our 2024 fiscal year on November 1, 2023, will further unify our portfolio and enhance the delivery of a true cloud experience for our customers and partners. They will enable tighter integrations that benefit our customers and partners and spark innovation. And, they position us to continue to win in the market.

We are creating a new Hybrid Cloud business unit, to be led by HPE Chief Technology Officer Fidelma Russo. This business will bring together the HPE GreenLake platform with the technologies and services of HPE Storage, HPE GreenLake Cloud Services Solutions and the current Office of the CTO organization. This new group will accelerate our hybrid cloud strategy as we deliver one portfolio of storage, software, data, and cloud services on the HPE GreenLake platform.  Over the past two years, Fidelma has led the team that created the HPE GreenLake platform, which is now the central offering for all of our Hybrid Cloud solutions, and developed, tested, and integrated new services and launched them on the platform. Fidelma and her team also led the onboarding of OpsRamp onto the platform and created an innovation pipeline that has delivered high-demand services like the Sustainability Dashboard.  Fidelma is a customer-centric leader and will continue to bring revolutionary new offerings to bear for our global customers, helping HPE realize our distinct advantage as we pursue opportunities in the hybrid cloud market.

Within the Hybrid Cloud organization, Tom Black will assume leadership of the new Private Cloud team, reporting to Fidelma. For the last three years, Tom has led our Storage business group through a transformation to a data services business – introducing the HPE Alletra portfolio and our first storage as-a-service offerings. I am grateful for his leadership and look forward to the innovation he will drive in this new role to further build out our business in this growing area of the hybrid-cloud market.

Vishal Lall will be leaving HPE at the end of the calendar year. Vishal has held a number of leadership positions at HPE and has made numerous contributions during his decade-long career with the company. His work spanning HPE GreenLake, HPE Aruba, HPE Ezmeral, and Hewlett Packard Pathfinder has had significant impact in driving the momentum and market opportunity HPE is now seeing, which puts us in a very strong position moving forward.

Pradeep Kumar, head of HPE Services, has been a remarkable leader at our company for 27 years. Over the past several months, he has shared with me his wishes to retire from HPE, which he has richly earned. With Pradeep’s retirement, we will now put the key operational activities for all of our products and services under one leader. HPE Services, Supply Chain and Quote-to-Cash will now comprise our Global Operations organization led by Mark Bakker. By aligning and optimizing our systems and processes and streamlining the end-to-end customer and partner experience, we will accelerate digital transformation for HPE and our customers. As I’ve said many times, I’m confident that we can accomplish anything with the right team guided by the right leaders. I believe we have both.

HPE GreenLake and Joyuus partner to provide health resources for post-partum women,2023-03-30,"All-women team of engineers helps startups have a purpose-driven impact for new moms
I’ve been fortunate over the years to have had many informal mentors who have encouraged and challenged me in my career. Without them, I wouldn’t be where I am today. Not everyone has that level of support, so when I joined Hewlett Packard Enterprise, I was pleased to see our genuine commitment to unconditional inclusion and an emphasis on increasing the ranks of talented women in technical roles. While there remains work to be done, I’m proud that HPE is among the leaders in this area.

At HPE, we encourage bold thinking and relentless curiosity. We empower team members to think strategically, be business leaders, and contribute to decisions so they can define their careers and have a positive impact on HPE’s direction and success. One way we do that is with Innovation Quest – an annual, global contest for team members to submit ideas that will help accelerate what’s next for HPE. In 2021, Innovation Quest received over a thousand submissions from around the globe. One of the five winning ideas in 2021, HPE GreenLake for Underrepresented Startups, proposed that we can use innovation as a force for good.

The HPE Diversity Startup program was designed by HPE engineers Joyce Roosz and Ana Rios-Rodriguez, to focus on helping businesses that serve mothers, people of color, people with disabilities, and other underrepresented communities excel. The program, which they designed working closely with HPE’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) team, provides startups with credits to use HPE GreenLake services so they can deliver digital solutions to these underserved communities more economically and effectively. The program was built out in the summer of 2021 and a year later The Provdotnet Group was identified as a channel partner to help roll out HPE GreenLake services to startups as part of their Alpha3 Cloud service offerings.Less than two years later, after lots of planning and integration work, a women-owned company called Joyuus was selected as the inaugural startup for the program and was onboarded in January of 2023. Joyuus is a digital health innovator dedicated to creating accessible well-being resources for mothers and those who care for them during their post-partum journey. Joyuus is specifically geared towards providing real-time, evidence-based, actionable health information and resources across physical, mental, and ‘real world’ needs to each of their users. The postpartum period (the first twelve months after giving birth) is critical for both maternal and child health and there are vast racial and ethnic disparities experienced by Black, Latina and other BIPOC women that need to be addressed. We are thrilled that HPE GreenLake, through our partnership with Provdotnet’s Alpha3 Cloud services, is helping provide Joyuus with the right-sized infrastructure platform and cloud services that serve their business needs.

As we close out Women’s History Month, I feel grateful to be part of an organization that has given me the opportunity to work with innovators from all walks of life, and to see women engineers thrive in an industry where they are still underrepresented.  I look forward to watching Ana and Joyce’s program grow and benefit more startups, and to encourage all of my colleagues across HPE find new ways to be a force for good.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/03/hpe-greenlake-and-joyuus-partner-to-provide-health-resources-for-post-partum-women.html,"IN THIS ARTICLE

HPE’s head of High Performance Computing & Artificial Intelligence business group tackles the toughest questions about AI everyday while ushering the world into the exascale era. He uses his unique background to build teams that have his back, while he keeps his vision focused on what’s next. We caught up with him to find out just who is Justin Hotard? So, who is Justin Hotard?

I'm someone who's constantly looking ahead at what's next. I’m always scenario planning in my head and thinking about how to put all the puzzle pieces together. I like to solve problems and enjoy the experience of learning.  The way I see it, learning is growing, and I don’t ever want to stop learning. 

Speaking of teams, how did growing up in Europe shape your views on building teams?

I grew up with kids from all over the world - Africa, Europe, the UK and Canada - which gave me the opportunity to be exposed to different cultures.  When I look at bringing together teams, I think about the entire composition of the team. This goes beyond functional expertise, and I believe the best teams are those that bring together different and unique skills. 

What’s the best career advice that you’ve received?

One piece of advice that I’ve lived by is to be genuine and true to yourself. Because if you aren’t being genuine, then people will eventually pick up on that, so be your true self...always. What excites you about supercomputing at HPE?

Just over a year ago, HPE launched the world’s most powerful exascale supercomputer marking a new era in artificial intelligence, scientific research, and innovation that solves calculations up to 10X faster than other top supercomputers. And when powered by responsible AI, we will be able to transform science, technology, and our daily lives to propel a new level of productivity and advancement for humankind. How can you not get excited about that?

AI has become a hot topic all over the world, what’s most exciting about AI to you?

I would say the potential for AI to improve outcomes in life sciences and healthcare. Too many people suffer and are lost to health issues like terminal illnesses.

Cooperation in a fragmented world: Three goals for the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2023,2023-01-17,"This year’s World Economic Forum Annual Meeting convenes at a critical inflection point in our fragmented world 
This week, Pam Carter, Antonio Neri, John Schultz, Justin Hotard, and I are honored to attend the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting as delegates representing Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In Davos, Switzerland, we are joining over 2,000 business, political, academic, and societal leaders committed to cooperation, innovation, and transformation for the benefit of the planet and her 7.8 billion residents.

This year’s Annual Meeting focuses on cooperation in a fragmented world. We are, by definition, a fragmented society simply by virtue of our backgrounds, lived experiences, cultures, and values. And yet, the most significant achievements in human history, like the triumph over fascism in World War II or putting humans into space – have been possible because despite that fragmentation, we found a way to bridge our differences to advance a common purpose. Today, the seemingly never-ending cascade of crises, heightened geo-economic division and fragmentation, financial sector vulnerabilities, and a spiraling climate crisis, cannot be solved by a single individual or organization – private and public cooperation is the only way forward. The future belongs to the fast, but depends on the cooperative. Technology has the opportunity to solve societal problems and advance human progress in a lasting, agile way – but cannot alone support the largescale transformation required. At this intersection of technology and cooperation that are needed for business and cultural transformation, corporate purpose and a commitment to continual engagement with disparate stakeholders are critical. How we show the world who we are, what we stand for, and what we very personally and accountably will do as brands and leaders determines who we attract as partners, customers, and innovators. This time in Davos presents significant opportunity for me to contribute to and learn from conversations that will support our company, the technology industry, and a global community of brand and reputation professionals. With this context, I arrived yesterday in Davos focused on three personal goals. Explore new collaborations and partnerships that will help Hewlett Packard Enterprise drive meaningful progress to solving the digital divide

By design, Davos convenes entities across public and private sectors to hold constructive and forward-looking dialogues that uncover solutions to unprecedented challenges. This week, I will attend sessions exploring technology platforms, demographic shifts, resource and energy systems, and capitalization. I will participate in conversations about stewarding responsible capitalism, ushering in a new era for value creation in the digital economy, propelling climate action forward, the dangers of disinformation, and the importance of strong cultures that advance business strategies forward.


Through sessions, meetings, and networking opportunities, I hope to find trusted collaborators who, like HPE, are using technology, digital culture, and skills development to help accelerate data-driven innovation. Together, we can uncover opportunities to work together to drive meaningful progress on challenges ranging from the climate crisis to public health to education in 2023 and beyond.
 Inspire and emerge inspired about making the future of work, work for early career talent

Participating in discussions around talent – particularly, early career talent and opportunities for women in technology – will be on my agenda for this year’s Forum. At HPE, we are focused on cultivating early career talent because the candidate pool is digitally native, learns quickly, and is receptive to change. Early career candidates have the foundational skills we need now and will be the leaders of our future. We have to make the future of work, work for them, just like our mentors and former leaders did for those of us now in leadership.

Many young recruits want to build an intentional career dedicated to work that is aligned to their values and vision for how they should contribute to society. While individual definitions of ‘meaningful work’ vary, as global leaders we share a common commitment to creating a diverse, inclusive environment with avenues for ideation and innovation that can lead to lasting societal benefit.

I honestly cannot recall a time in my career when a strong commitment to attracting, motivating, inspiring, and supporting our top talent has been more essential. Our collective ability to emerge from such a chaotic recent past and fuel a promising future depends on it.

Continue to foster a robust community of business leaders with the shared charter of converting reputation and brand loyalty to business performance

It takes a long time to build a reputation, and only an instant to ruin it with a single bad decision. I find it very encouraging and appropriate that Chief Communications Officers attend Davos today, facilitating much-needed dialogue around trust, purpose, and action. The Chief Communications Officer role is often referred to as the conscience of the company. And, our company conscience – our corporate character – increasingly serves as a key differentiator when navigating competitive markets. Brand and reputation are significant considerations when business strategy is formed and evaluated. In Davos, I look forward to interacting with other leading communications, marketing, brand, and corporate affairs leaders to discuss how our profession can continue to be a powerful multiplier of both business performance and societal action.

The last time I was in Davos was 2019, about six months into my tenure at HPE. Four years later, the chance to return is a thrilling one. It’s one of those invigorating business trips where my mind works in overdrive. It’s intellectual stimulation on a whole different level. After everything we have collectively been through over the last several years, this kind of forum is such a welcome opportunity to share, learn, and commit to action.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/01/cooperation-in-a-fragmented-world-three-goals-for-the-world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2023.html,"IN THIS ARTICLE

Combining a relevant strategy with strong execution to deliver a record-setting Q1 performance,2023-03-02,"HPE delivers record-setting Q1 performance and raises fiscal 2023 guidance 
As we report HPE’s first quarter results today, I am extremely pleased with our performance. After delivering an outstanding fourth quarter last year, we leveraged that strength to deliver a record-setting Q1. Our performance reflects the relevance of our strategy that addresses megatrends around edge, cloud and AI. It also shows the transformation of our industry-leading portfolio and the outstanding execution of our team. Here are a few highlights from the quarter:

 

HPE generated our highest Q1 revenue since 2016, with total revenue climbing 18%1 year-over-year to $7.8 billion, significantly above the high end of our outlook.

We again expanded non-GAAP operating margin, this time to a record 11.8%2, up 80 basis points year-over-year.

Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share (EPS)2 increased 19% year-over-year to $0.63, our highest ever.

We raised revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance for the full fiscal year, reflecting continued confidence in our long-term strategy and execution. Enhancing innovation through strategic acquisitions

Our differentiated portfolio continues to gain traction. In addition to driving organic innovation across the company, we continue to make strategic acquisitions that enhance what we can offer to our customers. We’ve recently announced several exciting acquisition agreements that complement and expand our offerings, including:

 

Cloud security provider Axis Security, announced today, which will help fortify network security and strengthen our Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solutions.

Athonet, announced last week, which will place HPE at the forefront of the growing private cellular networking market by creating one of the most complete portfolios in private 5G and wireless connectivity.

TidalScale, announced in Q1, has introduced scalable compute software technologies to our portfolio, adding additional choice points for customers to meet their compute and data-intensive workload needs.

Pachyderm, also announced in Q1, allows us to integrate reproducible AI software with our supercomputing and AI solutions, further expanding our AI-at-scale capabilities.
 

HPE has a successful track record of anticipating what comes next for our customers and investing in innovation that addresses their data-first modernization needs, with an unmatched set of edge-to-cloud solutions.

Driving business momentum

Since we began our edge-to-cloud transformation in 2019, we have consistently grown our as-a-service business, underpinned by the success of our HPE GreenLake platform. The relevance of HPE GreenLake with customers, combined with our disciplined execution, has propelled both annualized revenue run rate (ARR)3 and our as-a-service total contract value higher. This quarter, we unlocked an impressive $1 billion in ARR for the first time. And over the last two years, we have more than doubled our as-a-service total contract value, reaching nearly $10 billion through the end of this quarter.

Impressively, in every one of our key segments during the first quarter, we produced more revenues as well as positive operating profit. Delivering for customers and shareholders

I am very proud of how our HPE team members have executed to achieve this quarter’s exceptional performance, especially given the uneven macro environment. We have kicked off fiscal 2023 with another set of standout results, positioning us very well to deliver a very strong business performance for the full fiscal year.

We look forward to the rest of the fiscal year, as we continue to be laser-focused on executing our winning strategy, creating unmatched innovation, and delivering significant results for our customers and shareholders.

This is the fifth year that Gartner has issued this report – and the fifth year that HPE has been recognized for its Completeness of Vision and Ability to Execute on that vision. This makes for HPE’s continuous 14 years of recognition as a Leader by Gartner. A Magic Quadrant provides a graphical competitive positioning of four types of technology providers, in markets where growth is high and provider differentiation is distinct: Leaders execute well against their current vision and are well positioned for tomorrow; Visionaries understand where the market is going or have a vision for changing market rules, but do not yet execute well; Niche Players focus successfully on a small segment, or are unfocused and do not out-innovate or outperform others; Challengers execute well today or may dominate a large segment, but do not demonstrate an understanding of market direction. A Gartner Magic Quadrant is a culmination of research in a specific market, giving you a wide-angle view of the relative positions of the market’s competitors.

"Strategic shift toward edge, hybrid cloud and AI delivers solid results in Q3",2023-08-29,"Revenue growth and gross margin expansion driven by outstanding peformance in Intelligent Edge and HPE GreenLake
Today, HPE reported third quarter financial performance, and I am pleased that we have delivered another solid quarter. In an IT market that is still pressured in some areas, we again increased our revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share, year-over-year. Our results are being driven by our intentional, ongoing shift to higher-growth, higher-margin parts of our portfolio. We delivered exceptional performance in the Intelligent Edge, where revenue set its fifth consecutive quarterly record, and HPE GreenLake, which has helped generate higher recurring revenue and gross profit across our product segments. Demand for our products and services grew sequentially in the third quarter across all business segments – driven by high-growth areas like AI and HPE GreenLake. 

Highlights from the quarter include:

 

HPE grew revenue 3.5%(1) year-over-year to $7.0 billion.

Non-GAAP gross margin(2) rose 120 basis points year-over-year to 35.9%, very close to the record level we achieved in the second quarter.

Higher profitability resulted in a 2% year-over-year increase in non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share(2) to 49 cents.

We generated $955 million dollars in free cash flow – an increase of nearly $370 million year-over-year.

We once again raised non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance for the full fiscal year.
Driving financial performance through HPE GreenLake 

Our strategic shift toward edge, hybrid cloud and AI delivered through our HPE GreenLake platform is working, generating higher recurring revenue and gross profit– driven by the increased mix of high-margin software and services. In Q3, HPE GreenLake delivered an annualized revenue run-rate (ARR)(3) of $1.3 billion, a 48%(1) increase year-over-year. As we grow our ARR, we are also increasing its share of high-margin software and services, which comprised 68% of our total ARR mix, up two percentage points from last quarter. HPE GreenLake continues to attract new customers – and compel existing customers to expand their contracts, with the platform now supporting 27,000 unique customer logos and 3.4 million connected devices. HPE GreenLake orders rose 122% year-over-year, resulting in a nearly $1.5 billion increase in as-a-service total contract value (TCV)(4) since last quarter. Our cumulative booked TCV now stands at nearly $12 billion. 

These results demonstrate the relevance of our HPE GreenLake value proposition of providing one unified hybrid-cloud experience to empower customers to access, analyze and extract value from their data – no matter where it lives – at the edge, in their colos or datacenter, or in the public cloud. 

Exceptional performance in the Intelligent Edge

HPE’s performance in the Intelligent Edge segment was particularly noteworthy in the quarter.  Revenue increased 53%(1) year-over-year and contributed 20% of our total company revenue. Operating profit more than doubled in another exceptional quarter for this business; it is now the largest source of HPE’s operating profit, at 49% of our total segment operating profit(2).

We are gaining share, benefiting from improved availability of supply, higher shipment volume, and a strong response to our SaaS edge offerings in terms of both demand and revenue. Momentum in Intelligent Edge was consistent around the globe, with revenue increasing by double digits year-over-year in all regions in the third quarter. 

Wave of demand in HPC & AI

We continue to see strong interest in our AI and supercomputing offerings from enterprise customers who are incorporating artificial intelligence into their businesses. This is translating into significantly higher demand for our HPC & AI business segment, as customers choose HPE for our unique end-to-end AI value proposition. As a result, we exited the quarter with the largest HPC & AI order book we have ever had. Our AI momentum has also helped grow our total HPE order book, which is now at more than two times pre-pandemic levels, driven by exceptional customer demand for our AI solutions. Only HPE can combine our unique AI software and Slingshot networking fabric, HPE Services offerings, and market-leading sustainable supercomputers, which power unprecedented levels of performance for AI at scale. Our open ecosystem of AI suppliers is also an advantage for customers, who are turning to us for a full spectrum of enterprise AI workloads and use cases – spanning large-scale model development, training and inferencing.

We are seeing AI projects generate exciting results on our supercomputers. For example, the HPE-built LUMI supercomputer, the fastest system in Europe and third fastest in the world, has enabled generative AI projects, such as creating the world’s largest Finnish language model, and has helped researchers apply AI for early detection of diagnosis of breast and prostate cancers.

And we continue to make progress in ushering in the era of exascale supercomputing, which enables unprecedented scale and performance for larger AI models, such as generative AI. This quarter, HPE, in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, started to build and test El Capitan, one of the largest upcoming exascale supercomputers. El Capitan, which is expected to reach 2 exaflops of peak performance, will allow researchers to apply AI to advance U.S. national security and make breakthroughs in medical and drug research initiatives. 

Shift to software- and services-rich businesses delivers for shareholders

Our third quarter performance demonstrates the progress we have made to shift our portfolio to higher-growth, higher-margin areas that are the most critical to customers as they continue to transform. Our pivot to software- and services-rich businesses has led to greater recurring revenue, margin, earnings per share, and free cash flow. 

Despite a slowdown in some parts of the IT industry, our HPE team has executed our strategy, bringing differentiated innovation and a diverse portfolio to our customers around the globe. This positions us to continue to win in the market and deliver for our shareholders.

HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise wins 2023 Stratus Award for private cloud provider,2023-09-20,"Award recognizes HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise as the leading product and service in the private cloud provider category
Public cloud has long been the default strategy for enterprises, but more and more enterprises are rebalancing workloads to private cloud for better price, performance and innovation. HPE recognized this shift in demand from customers and created HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise. On September 20, the Business Intelligence Group awarded Hewett Packard Enterprise (HPE) with a 2023 Stratus Award for Cloud Computing for the top product and service in the private cloud provider category.

“Different workloads have different characteristics and require different approaches to achieve the best cost and performance. Increasingly, private cloud is the preferred choice for enterprises that want an agile cloud operating experience with the cost efficiency, performance, reliability and security of their enterprise’s own IT environment. This is what HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise delivers,” said Bryan Thompson, vice president of product management, HPE GreenLake cloud services solutions. Based on interviews with CIO-level leaders across companies, Constellation Research estimates that rebalancing from public to private cloud is, on average, 50% less expensive, 65% more performant, and twice as fast for development cycles1. HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise enables enterprises to streamline and modernize across their multi-gen IT with a fully managed cloud experience for bare metal, containers, and VMs in a private environment.

In June, HPE announced the expansion of its private cloud portfolio including the addition of HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Business Edition, an expanded partnership with Equinix and new enhancements that address multi-cloud use cases by providing upcoming support to deploy Red Hat OpenShift.

"Creating the future together with new innovation across edge, cloud and AI",2023-06-23,"At HPE, we are preparing our customers and partners to take advantage of advanced technologies across edge, hybrid cloud and A.I. that enable us to uncover insight and drive action like never before
This week, I was happy to have the opportunity to gather with 10,000 Hewlett Packard Enterprise customers and partners, and team members for our annual HPE Discover event.  The energy was electric as we introduced incredible new innovation and discussed new ways HPE’s edge-to-cloud portfolio can help customers harness the power of their data to advance their digital transformations.

As I reflect on the week’s conversations, it is clear we are entering a new era, driven by one of the most exciting technologies the world has ever seen: artificial intelligence. It will affect every industry, as well as every level of computing, from the smallest IoT device to the largest exascale supercomputer. And it will require that enterprises be edge-centric, cloud-enabled, and data-driven – characteristics I asserted would define the enterprise of the future when I became CEO more than five years ago.  At HPE, we are preparing our customers and partners to take advantage of advanced technologies across edge, hybrid cloud and A.I. that enable us to uncover insight and drive action like never before.

Edge: Leveraging data with the most intelligent, secure, and advanced networking portfolio

We all know how data is exploding at the edge. In 2018, we declared the edge would be the next frontier, and since then, we have invested more than $5.5 billion to build the world’s best, most intelligent, secure, and advanced networking portfolio with more than 27 million HPE Aruba access points in the field, and more than 3,600 customers of our SD-WAN solutions, powered by our Silver Peak acquisition.

Making it all work efficiently and at scale requires smart and A.I.-enhanced predictive management tools, as well as end-to-end security. Our acquisition of Axis Security, an industry leader in SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) is helping us address the convergence of the network and security markets, and the ongoing build-out of the hybrid cloud.

Our newest data center infrastructure products, led by the HPE Aruba CX 10000 switch, are key to tying resources together and offer a unique blend of performance, scale, and automation. We are also leading the convergence of wireless technologies, thanks to our acquisition of Athonet, will power a seamless experience across Private 5G and W-Fi.

Today, all of our HPE Aruba Networking offerings are cloud subscription-based and available on our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. Together, they provide the simplicity to deploy connectivity at scale through an intuitive cloud operating experience.

Hybrid Cloud: HPE GreenLake services for every enterprise

For years, I have said the world would be hybrid – and that prediction has come true as businesses seek to blend the best of on-premises and public-cloud resources. It’s a powerful mix but it’s hard to get it right.  Organizations need a unified experience across all workloads that is open and secure, as well as sustainable. HPE GreenLake is the core of that experience.

At HPE Discover, we extended our hybrid cloud leadership with new HPE GreenLake cloud services, including SaaS solutions from recent acquisition OpsRamp and for backup and machine learning, as well as expanded NaaS offerings.

Of course, no hybrid cloud strategy is complete without coherent integration with the public cloud. We have expanded HPE’s relationship with AWS to simplify the hybrid cloud transformation for enterprises. And for private cloud workloads, to drive faster, easier, and more sustainable ways to deploy HPE GreenLake outside your data center, we have significantly expanded our partnership with colo market leader, Equinix. The partnership enables customers to go from quote to production in just days, adding capacity and scale on-demand. We’re also expanding our HPE GreenLake private cloud portfolio with HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Business Edition, a new offering that allows customers to spin up virtual machines across hybrid clouds on demand. 

A.I.: The next great frontier

We have all seen how newly-available A.I. tools can give businesses superpowers – of insight, speed, capacity, and efficiency. A.I. is the most disruptive technology of our lifetimes, and we are at the inflection point of its application.

An opportunity of this magnitude requires an appropriately-scaled response. So, we made one of the biggest announcements we have ever made on the HPE Discover stage.

We believe that powerful and trusted A.I. training tools must be accessible to all organizations. We’re making that possible by entering the A.I. cloud market.

We’re using our industry-leading supercomputing to power our new service, HPE GreenLake for Large Language Models. It will enable any enterprise to privately train, tune, and deploy large-scale A.I. through our on-demand supercomputing cloud service.

We built HPE GreenLake for LLM in partnership with Aleph Alpha, using its pre-trained Luminous model. The service can work with customers’ private data sets to create LLMs in five languages. Models can be trained from scratch and then deployed for private (or public) use. It’s the ideal solution for creating generative A.I. models based on proprietary data: unlike consumer-grade models, your data remains yours. And it is the first in a series of industry- and domain-specific A.I. applications that HPE plans to launch in the future, including climate modeling, healthcare and financial services. Performance, speed and accuracy are all essential when pursuing A.I. But one other critical consideration is the sustainability impact of A.I. workloads. Energy efficiency must be embedded into A.I. strategies. HPE GreenLake for LLM will run in sustainable colocation facilities. These facilities include sophisticated direct liquid-cooling capabilities and waste-heat reuse initiatives as part of the solution that can make the footprint carbon negative.

How a coding competition can lead to a career in tech,2023-03-06,"Drew Neyland, former CodeWars student, now a software engineer at HPE, tells us how friendly competitions can spark a career
For 26 years, HPE has hosted CodeWars, a first-class computer programming competition for high school students. The event invites teams of students aged between 13 and 18 years old, sponsored by their teachers and schools, to compete against one another to solve coding problems.

Student are encouraged to push their problem-solving limits, while HPE volunteers their tech talent to help mentor these students to see past this challenge and explore a career in tech.

We caught up with one former student, Drew Neyland, who followed his passion for problem solving and is now a software engineer at HPE, to tell us how competitions like CodeWars can spark a career.
 

How did you learn about CodeWars? How many years did you participate?

I learned about CodeWars when I was a freshman in high school from my computer science teacher. I enjoyed the programming I was doing, but I knew nothing about any kind of formal competitions. I participated for three years - 2009, 2011 and 2012.


How do you think having access to programs like this shaped your career goals? Did you know what you wanted to be, before having access to coding?

I had absolutely no clue what I wanted to do before I got access to coding. Admittedly, I was in middle school when I had my first brush with it. After about two or three years of participating in competitions like CodeWars, I sat down with my computer one Saturday to work on practice problems. The problems led to me wanting to code a game and before I knew it, I’d missed lunch and dinner because I was so engrossed in what I was doing.  What have you learned from participating in the challenge – what were your biggest takeaways?

One of my biggest takeaways was learning how much programming is done before you write a line of code or put your hands on the keyboard. You need to understand a problem, break it up, and then formulate the methods of how to solve it. If you’re writing code before you’ve solved the problem, you’re going to be hundreds of lines of code deep in a problem and realize you can’t make the ends meet up because of something you didn’t consider in the beginning.


Why do you still take an active part in CodeWars?

This is my first year volunteering, but I do think there is something about trying to solve as many problems as you can in a tight time limit that exponentially increases your learning, more so than I found just listening to lectures or from reading. It provides an opportunity for students to apply what they’ve learned and interact with other people around them who have the same interests.

What advice do you have for students who aren’t sure if coding is something they can do?


Spend time investing in your problem-solving skills, and explore solving those problems without worrying about a programming language. Just write out the simplest steps to solve a given problem that can be used to solve the problem repeatedly, independent of a given data set. Once you’ve developed those ‘muscles,’ then pick up a simple language like Java or Python and see if you can translate those steps into code.

Those problem-solving skills can transfer to the different programming languages you’ll learn along the way.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/03/how-a-coding-competition-can-lead-to-a-career-in-tech.html,,"['How did CodeWars help you develop your problem-solving skills?', 'What was the most challenging problem you had to solve during the competition?', 'How did you apply the skills you learned from CodeWars in your career as a software engineer?']","[' CodeWars helped Drew Neyland develop his problem-solving skills by encouraging him to push his limits and providing him with opportunities to apply what he had learned. He learned how to break down problems into smaller, more manageable parts and formulate methods for solving them. This helped him become a more efficient and effective problem solver, which in turn helped him excel in his career as a software engineer at HPE.', "" The most challenging problem Drew Neyland had to solve during the CodeWars competition was one that required him to understand a problem, break it up, and then formulate the methods of how to solve it. He learned that if you're writing code before you've solved the problem, you're going to be hundreds of lines of code deep in a problem and realize you can't make the ends meet up because of something you didn't consider in the beginning."", ' Drew Neyland, a former CodeWars student and now a software engineer at HPE, applied the skills he learned from CodeWars in his career by using them to solve complex problems and develop software solutions. He emphasized the importance of understanding a problem, breaking it down into smaller parts, and formulating methods to solve it before writing any code. This approach helped him to write efficient and effective code, which was crucial in his role as a software engineer. Additionally, Drew found that the competitive nature of CodeWars helped him to develop his problem-solving skills and work well under pressure, which were valuable skills in his career.']"

1 A description of HPE’s use of non-GAAP financial information is provided below under “Use of non-GAAP financial information and key performance metrics.”  2 Annualized Revenue Run-Rate (“ARR”) is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-Service, software consumption revenue, and other as-a-Service offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it.  3 Free cash flow represents cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant & equipment (“PP&E”) less proceeds from the sale of PP&E) and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.  4 Non-GAAP operating profit excludes costs of approximately $0.9 billion primarily related to stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges.  5 Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides certain guidance on a non-GAAP basis. In reliance on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is unable to provide a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts, as the Company cannot predict some elements that are included in such directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These elements could have a material impact on the Company’s reported GAAP results for the guidance period. Refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures below for more information.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of revenue growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, non-GAAP operating profit growth, and free cash flow. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures for this quarter and prior periods are included in the tables below or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release. In addition an explanation of the ways in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its business, the substance behind Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s decision to use these non-GAAP measures, the material limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures, the manner in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management compensates for those limitations, and the substantive reasons why Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide supplemental useful information to investors is included further below. This additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, gross profit, gross profit margin, operating profit (earnings from operations), operating profit margin (earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), net earnings, diluted net earnings per share, and cash flow from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.  In addition to the supplemental non-GAAP financial information, Hewlett Packard Enterprise also presents annualized revenue run-rate (""ARR"") and as-a-Service (""AAS"") orders as performance metrics. ARR is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income for operating leases and interest income from finance leases), and Software-as-a-Service (""SaaS""), software consumption revenue, and other as-a-Service offerings recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. AAS orders are an overlay across all business segments contributing to HPE's consumption-based services (both recurring and non-recurring revenues), and includes hardware, as well as HPE GreenLake as-a-Service, Aruba SaaS, Storage SaaS, and other Software assets. ARR & AAS orders should be viewed independently of net revenue and deferred revenue and are not intended to be combined with any of these items.  Forward-looking statements  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(1)   The Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $905 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as it was determined that the fair value of the HPC & AI and Software reporting units was below the carrying value of their net assets. Software is under the Corporate Investments and Other reportable segment.  (2)   Represents the amortization of basis difference adjustments related to H3C. The twelve months ended October 31, 2023 also included the Company's portion of intangible asset impairment charges from H3C of $8 million.  (3)   Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company implemented certain organizational changes to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. This resulted in the transfer of certain storage networking products, previously reported within the Storage reportable segment, to the Compute reportable segment. The Company reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which primarily resulted in the transfer of net revenue and operating profit for each of the businesses as described above. These changes had no impact on the Company's previously reported consolidated results.  (4)   Diluted net earnings per share reflects any dilutive effect of restricted stock awards, stock options and performance based awards, but the effect is excluded when calculating GAAP diluted net loss per share because it would be anti-dilutive.
Use of non-GAAP financial measures  To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides financial measures including revenue on a constant currency basis (including at the business segment level), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of revenue growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, non-GAAP operating profit growth, and free cash flow.  These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to revenue on a constant currency basis is revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) is earnings from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue) is operating profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income tax rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow is cash flow from operations. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures for this quarter and prior periods are included in the tables above or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release.  Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors  Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that providing the non-GAAP financial measures stated above in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results “through the eyes” of management. Hewlett Packard Enterprise further believes that providing this information provides Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s investors with a supplemental view to understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s historical and prospective operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates the comparisons of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance with the performance of other companies in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.  Economic substance of and material limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise  Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change to the foreign exchange rate utilized in the comparable prior-year period. This measure assists investors with evaluating the past and future performance of the Company, without the impact of foreign exchange rates. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges relating to the amortization of initial direct costs, stock-based compensation expense and disaster charges. Non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) and non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue) consist of earnings from operations or earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue excluding those same charges above and charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding the charges previously stated, as well as tax indemnification and other adjustments, non-service net periodic benefit cost (credit), earnings from equity interests, impairment of investment, and adjustments for taxes. The Adjustments for taxes line item includes certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform, structural rate adjustment, excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, and adjustments for additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item.  Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures provides a supplemental view to management and investors of the consolidated financial performance of the Company without costs that Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Exclusion of these items can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP measure and cash flows thus limiting their use as analytical tools.  These limitations are discussed below or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release. More specifically, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons:
 
•      Amortization of initial direct costs represents the portion of lease origination costs incurred in prior fiscal years that do not qualify for capitalization under the new leasing standard. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these costs as the Company elected the practical expedient under the new leasing standard. As a result, the Company did not adjust these historical costs to accumulated deficit. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that most financing companies did not elect this practical expedient and therefore the Company excludes these costs. Exclusion of these costs can have an impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure and HPE Financial Services segment results.  
•      Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions. Consequently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses and the Company’s internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding intangible asset amortization. Amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s cash position, represents the loss in value of intangible assets over time and can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.  
•      Transformation costs represent net costs related to the (i) HPE Next Plan and (ii) Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to transform the Company’s IT infrastructure, net gains from the sale of real estate and any impairment charges on real-estate identified as part of the initiatives. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these costs as they are discrete costs related to two specific transformation programs that were announced in 2017 and 2020, respectively, as multi-year programs necessary to transform the business and IT infrastructure following material divestiture transactions in 2017 and in response to COVID-19 and an evolving product portfolio in fiscal 2020. The primary elements of the HPE Next and the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan have been substantially completed by October 31, 2023. The exclusion of the transformation program costs from the non-GAAP measures, as stated above, is to provide a supplemental measure of the Company’s operating results that do not include material HPE Next Plan and Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan costs as the Company’s management does not believe such costs to be reflective of the ongoing operating cost structure. Further, the transformation costs for these plans have materially fluctuated since 2017, have been materially declining since 2021 and are not expected to be material beyond fiscal 2023. Hewlett Packard Enterprises management believes that non-GAAP measures excluding these costs are useful to management and investors for comparing operating performance across multiple periods.  
•      Disaster charges are primarily related to the exit of the Company’s businesses in Russia and Belarus and include credit losses of financing receivables and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned assets. Disaster charges also include direct costs or recovery of these costs related to COVID-19 as a result of Hewlett Packard Enterprise-hosted, co-hosted, or sponsored event cancellations and subsequent shift to a virtual format. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes Disaster charges from these non-GAAP measures as the specific charges are non-recurring charges and not indicative of the operational performance of the Company’s business.  
•      Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses, and internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and competitors present non-GAAP financial measures excluding stock-based compensation expense.  
•      Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs costs related to its acquisition, disposition and other related charges. The charges are direct expenses, such as professional fees and retention costs, most of which are treated as non-cash or non-capitalized expenses. Charges may also include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal and arbitration settlements in connection with certain dispositions. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these costs as these expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of acquisitions and divestitures, and internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding stock-based compensation expense.  
•      Tax indemnification and other adjustments are primarily related to changes to certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise remains liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these income or charges and the associated tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods.  
•      Non-service net periodic benefit cost/credit includes certain market-related factors such as (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains or losses, (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments and (vi) impacts from other market-related factors associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise's defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans. These market-driven retirement-related adjustments are primarily due to the change in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures and considers them to be outside the operational performance of the business.  
•      Adjustment to earnings from equity interests includes the amortization of the basis difference in relation to the H3C divestiture and the resulting equity method investment in H3C. In the first fiscal quarter of 2023, this adjustment also included the Company's portion of intangible asset impairment charges from H3C. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating this amount for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods.  
•         In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, HPE recorded an impairment charge for an equity investment resulting from a permanent reduction of the investee’s assets. This adjustment was reflected in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. HPE believes eliminating the impairment of investment for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods.  
•         Hewlett Packard Enterprise utilizes a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to provide consistency across the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly related to the Company’s operating structure that can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, Hewlett Packard Enterprise evaluated a three-year financial projection. The projected rate assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year projection period and considers other factors including Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where Hewlett Packard Enterprise operates. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company used a non-GAAP income tax rate of 14%. The non-GAAP income tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that making these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures, facilitates a supplemental evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.  
•      Free cash flow (“FCF”) is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant & equipment (“PP&E”) less proceeds from the sale of PP&E) and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management and investors can use FCF for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in the Company’s businesses, repurchasing stock and other purposes as well as evaluating historical and prospective liquidity.  Compensation for material limitations with use of non-GAAP financial measures
 These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are that they can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures and cash flows, they may be calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes and may not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of certain assets. Hewlett Packard Enterprise compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for this quarter and prior periods within this news release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise encourages investors to review those reconciliations carefully.",,Hewlett Packard Enterprise reports Q4 results to close impressive fiscal 2023; raises dividend in fiscal 2024,,

"HPE Spaceborne Computer program: The incredible journey of a computer at the farthest edge
",2024-01-29,"N THIS ARTICLE
Ahead of a third launch into space, we take a look back at HPE's journey in designing a computer at the farthest edge – space
HPE Spaceborne Computer-2 delivers data center performance and targeted AI capabilities to meet in-orbit data processing needs and advance space exploration

As the HPE Spaceborne Computer program celebrates its third journey to the International Space Station, let us take a look back at the various design and maintenance challenges faced by HPE and NASA in the system’s creation.  There is no such thing as a straightforward journey to space for a computer operated at the farthest edge. From an off-the-shelf HPE Apollo 40 server used in Spaceborne Computer-1 to the HPE Edgeline EL4000 and HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen10 servers powering the Spaceborne Computer-2, HPE engineers and researchers had to iterate and learn on-the-go to meet the highest standards of NASA.
There is no such thing as a straightforward journey to space for a computer operated at the farthest edge 
These are some of the unforeseen challenges HPE faced throughout our journey sending a powerful computing system to space.  Put a square peg in a round hole  “Well, I suggest you gentlemen then find a way to put a square peg in a round hole”. This cult line from Gene Kranz's character in ""Apollo 13"" sums up the very first challenge that HPE faced in designing HPE Spaceborne Computer.  On Earth, datacenter components are rectangular in shape to optimize space when racked. The orbiting station however, is an assembly of modules in a cylindrical shape. The design of HPE Spaceborne Computer thus started with an exercise of design and geometry in order to make four-sided shapes into circles. This included the creation of a custom chassis and novel sideways installation.  Assembly and maintenance by astronauts  To enable IT-savvy customers to resolve issues or do routine maintenance on Earth, HPE delivers replacement parts along with instructions on how to install them. A common practice for handling objects is to grab, pull or lift.  In space, however, weightlessness requires an astronaut to stabilize themself by holding on to several fixed points. It is impossible for an astronaut to follow Earth-made instructions at the risk of pushing themself across the space station. Therefore, even before the launch of Spaceborne Computer, all the operation and maintenance manuals were revised to meet NASA space standards for the crew members.

Proven in space, available on Earth  In space, every being and thing floats if it is not attached to a fixed point. While HPE's experts had the foresight to create structure docking to prevent the first HPE Spaceborne Computer from floating freely on the space station, they did not fully anticipate all the consequences the lack of gravity had on the inner parts. Without gravity, unattached components will float inside the chassis, including internal wiring. These wires ventured too close to the system’s cooling fans, which sanded the wires down over time, producing and releasing dust inside the system that was later caught by filters.  The HPE team created and immediately implemented a solution to secure the wires for HPE Spaceborne Computer-2. Additionally, the team documented the issue and solution, submitting it for consideration in future product designs, encompassing components in vehicles and other moving objects, including those on Earth.  Reaching the space station  Let’s talk about the elephant in the room. The space station is a non-geostationary object and completes a revolution of the Earth about every 90 minutes. As such, it only has a maximum of two satellites pointing at it at any given time of day. And there are points in time when communication with Earth is not possible.  As soon as communications with the space station comes back online, everyone on Earth wants to reach it, which reduces the already stressed bandwidth and affects astronauts in their capacity to conduct research. This bottlenecking is among the strongest proof points supporting the need for edge computing in space.  A physical device on the space station that sequences DNA locally generates 22GB of data each time. Rather than send all 22GB of data to Earth, the HPE Spaceborne Computer processed the data onboard, ultimately producing an output file that was 235KB, reducing the amount of time it takes to share research insights between space and Earth.
From zero to zero-gravity in 13 months
From the drawing board to space in 13 months  The first iteration of HPE Spaceborne Computer, which is retroactively referred to as HPE Spaceborne Computer-1, was one of the most time-constrained projects HPE ever faced. From zero to zero-gravity in 13 months. Ultimately, some components and ideas were abandoned. In response to suggestions from NASA and the crew, our experts optimized HPE Spaceborne Computer-2 and added new features. One of these improvements included adding 10 gigabit Ethernet. And while generally, HPE considers USB ports on data center hardware a vulnerability that should be avoided, the space station is not exactly your typical data center. Since the crew has a need to analyze data frequently, external USB ports were also added to HPE Spaceborne Computer-2.  After two successful trips to the International Space Station, the latest iteration of this system has added over 130 TB of flash-based storage, the most to ever travel to the space station on a single mission. Thanks to our collaborators at KIOXIA, this addition means it will be possible to run new types of applications and conduct research using larger data sets, this includes the ability to run more artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads.  We look forward to sharing new insights and revelations from this third tour to space while yet again providing the international scientific community access to high performance computing and data center-level AI/ML processing capabilities in space.",,"N THIS ARTICLE
