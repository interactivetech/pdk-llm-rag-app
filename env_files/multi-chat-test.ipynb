      "answer:   Based on the given document, a healthy dinner is salmon. Salmon is a lean protein source that is high in omega-3 fatty acids and can be prepared in various ways such as grilling or baking. It's important to note that while salmon is generally considered a healthy option, it should be consumed in moderation due to its high levels of mercury. Additionally, it's always best to pair salmon with other nutrient-dense foods like vegetables for a well-rounded meal.\n"
